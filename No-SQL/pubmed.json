In previous studies, the galacturonosyltransferase-like (GATL) gene family has been shown to be involved in pectin synthesis. However, few studies have been performed on cotton GATL genes. Here, a total of 33, 17, and 16 GATL genes were respectively identified in Gossypium hirsutum, Gossypium raimondii, and Gossypium arboreum. In multiple plant species, phylogenetic analysis divided GATL genes into five groups named GATL-a to GATL-e, and the number of groups was found to gradually change over evolution. Whole genome duplication (WGD) and segmental duplication played a significant role in the expansion of the GATL gene family in G. hirsutum. Selection pressure analyses revealed that GATL-a and GATL-b groups underwent a great positive selection pressure during evolution. Moreover, the expression patterns revealed that most of highly expressed GhGATL genes belong to GATL-a and GATL-b groups, which have more segmental duplications and larger positive selection value, suggesting that these genes may play an important role in the evolution of cotton plants. We overexpressed GhGATL2, GhGATL9, GhGATL12, and GhGATL15 in Arabidopsis and silenced the GhGATL15 gene in cotton through a virus induced gene silencing assay (VIGS). The transgenic and VIGS lines showed significant differences in stem diameter, epidermal hair length, stamen length, seed size, and fiber length than the control plant. In addition, the pectin content test proved that the pectin was significantly increased in the transgenic lines and reduced in VIGS plants, demonstrating that GhGATL genes have similar functions and act on the pectin synthesis to regulate plant growth and fiber elongation. In summary, we performed a comprehensive analysis of GhGATL genes in G. hirsutum including evolution, structure and function, in order to better understand GhGATL genes in cotton for further studies.\n","1":"\nTolypocladium guangdongense, formerly known as Cordyceps guangdongensis, is a widely cultivated fungus of the Cordyceps s.l. species that has been investigated over the last 12\u00a0years. It has the potential to be used in a number of applications in the health and pharmaceutical industries for it has shown its high nutritional and medicinal values according to previous animal studies. qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) is extensively used to analyze the expression pattern and molecular mechanisms of functional genes under differentially experimental conditions. The expression stability of reference genes used for normalization determines the reliability of qRT-PCR results, indicating the importance of selection and validation of reference genes before gene expression analysis. In the present study, three statistical algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, were used for analyzing the expression stability of nineteen candidate reference genes (CRGs) in T. guangdongense. Investigation were carried out under differentially experimental conditions, which included differentially developmential stages (mycelia, primordia, young and mature fruiting bodies), different carbon sources, cold and heat stresses. The results showed that histone H4 and tubulin beta chain 2 (\u03b2-tub2) were the most and least stable genes, respectively, across all the experimental samples. Moreover, analysis of individual data sets exhibited different stability and expression profiles of reference genes. The vacuolar protein sorting gene VPS was the most stable gene expressed under the differentially developmental stages and temperature stresses, whereas H4 was the most stably expressed gene under different carbon sources. Therefore, it can be proposed that VPS and H4 are the preferred reference genes for normalization of gene expression under different experimental conditions. The results of our present study will enable more accurate evaluation of gene expression in T. guangdongense using the optimal reference gene for qRT-PCR analysis.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n","2":"\nThe selection of a suitable reference gene assures a reliable gene expression analysis when using the qPCR method. Normalization of the reaction is based on the basic metabolism genes. These genes show a constant, unregulated expression in all cells and function throughout their lifetime. In the current study, seven reference gene candidates were screened using RT-qPCR, to determine the best-matched pair of reference genes in the chicken DT40 cell line. The DT40 was derived from bursal lymphoma cells that were subjected to RAV-1 bird retroviral infection. It is a simplified in vitro model that allows tracking the direct interaction of stimulants on the lymphoid population and profiling of the hepatocellular B cell transcriptome. The reference gene analysis was carried out using statistical tools integrating four independent methods-geNorm, Best Keeper, NormFinder, delta Ct and RefFinder. Based on the selected reference genes, the relative gene expression analysis was done using the ddCt method. Complete relative gene expression study on a panel of the target genes revealed that proper selection of reference genes depending on the tissue eliminate decreases in data quality. The SDHA and RPL4 genes constitute stable internal controls as reference genes when analyzing gene expression in the DT40 cell line.\n","3":"\nThe selection of reference genes is essential for quantifying gene expression. Theoretically they should be expressed stably and not regulated by experimental or pathological conditions. However, identification and validation of reference genes for human cancer research are still being regarded as a critical point, because cancerous tissues often represent genetic instability and heterogeneity. Recent pan-cancer studies have demonstrated the importance of the appropriate selection of reference genes for use as internal controls for the normalization of gene expression; however, no stably expressed, consensus reference genes valid for a range of different human cancers have yet been identified.\nIn the present study, we used large-scale cancer gene expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, which contains 10,028 (9,364 cancerous and 664 normal) samples from 32 different cancer types, to confirm that the expression of the most commonly used reference genes is not consistent across a range of cancer types. Furthermore, we identified 38 novel candidate reference genes for the normalization of gene expression, independent of cancer type. These genes were found to be highly expressed and highly connected to relevant gene networks, and to be enriched in transcription-translation regulation processes. The expression stability of the newly identified reference genes across 29 cancerous and matched normal tissues were validated via quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR).\nWe reveal that most commonly used reference genes in current cancer studies cannot be appropriate to serve as representative control genes for quantifying cancer-related gene expression levels, and propose in this study three potential reference genes (HNRNPL, PCBP1, and RER1) to be the most stably expressed across various cancerous and normal human tissues.\n","4":"\nAbscisic acid (ABA) plays important roles in multiple physiological processes, such as plant response to stresses and plant development. The ABA receptors pyrabactin resistance (PYR)\/ PYR1-like (PYL)\/regulatory components of ABA receptor (RCAR) play a crucial role in ABA perception and signaling. However, little is known about the details regarding PYL family genes in Brassica juncea var. tumida. Here, 25 PYL family genes were identified in B. juncea var. tumida genome, including BjuPYL3, BjuPYL4s, BjuPYL5s, BjuPYL6s, BjuPYL7s, BjuPYL8s, BjuPYL10s, BjuPYL11s, and BjuPYL13. The results of phylogenic analysis and gene structure showed that the PYL family genes performed similar gene characteristics. By analyzing cis-elements in the promoters of those BjuPYLs, several hormone and stress related cis-elements were found. The results of gene expression analysis showed that the ABA receptor homologous genes were induced by abiotic and biotic stress. The tissue-specific gene expression patterns of BjuPYLs also suggested those genes might regulate the stem swelling during plant growth. These findings indicate that BjuPYLs are involved in plant response to stresses and organ development. This study provides valuable information for further functional investigations of PYL family genes in B. juncea var. tumida.\n","5":"\nRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)-based gene expression analysis is applicable to a wide range of biological purposes in various species. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is also used to assess target gene expression utilizing stably expressed reference genes as internal control under a given set of conditions. However, investigations of the reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization in the process of somatic embryogenesis (SE) initial dedifferentiation in Gossypium hirsutum are rarely reported. In this study, on the basis of our previous transcriptome data of three different induction stages during SE initial dedifferentiation process in four G. hirsutum cultivars that have different SE capability, 15 candidate genes were selected during SE initial dedifferentiation process, and their expression stability was evaluated by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results indicated that the two genes of endonuclease 4 (ENDO4) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) showed stable expression in the four different G. hirsutum cultivars, endowing them to be appropriate reference genes during three induction stages in the four cotton cultivars. In addition, the stability and reliability of the two reference genes of ENDO4 and 18S rRNA were further verified by comparing the expressions of auxin-responsive protein 22 (AUX22) and ethylene-responsive transcription factor 17 (ERF17) between RT-qPCR results and the RNA-seq data, which showed strong positive correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.8396-0.9984), validating again the steady expression of ENDO4 and 18S rRNA as the reliable reference genes. Our results provide effective reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization during SE process in different G. hirsutum cultivars.\n","6":"\nSkin cutaneous melanoma (SCM) is a common malignant tumor of the skin and its pathogenesis still needs to be studied. In this work, we constructed a co-expression network and screened for hub genes by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) using the GSE98394 dataset. The relationship between the mRNA expression of hub genes and the prognosis of patients with melanoma was validated by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry in the Human Protein Atlas was used to validate hub genes and grayscale analysis was performed using ImageJ software. It was found that the yellow module was most significantly associated with the difference between common nevus and SCM, and 13 genes whose expression correlation >0.9 were candidate hub genes. The expression of three genes (STK26, KCNT2, CASP12) was correlated with the prognosis of SCM. STK26 (P = 0.0024) and KCNT2 (P < 0.0001) were significantly different between normal skin and SCM. These three hub genes have potential value as predictors for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of SCM in the future.\n","7":"\nPancreatic cancer is one of the malignant tumors that threaten human health.\nThe gene expression profiles of GSE15471, GSE19650, GSE32676 and GSE71989 were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database including pancreatic cancer and normal samples. The differentially expressed genes between the two types of samples were identified with the Limma package using R language. The gene ontology functional and pathway enrichment analyses of differentially-expressed genes were performed by the DAVID software followed by the construction of a protein-protein interaction network. Hub gene identification was performed by the plug-in cytoHubba in cytoscape software, and the reliability and survival analysis of hub genes was carried out in The Cancer Genome Atlas gene expression data.\nThe 138 differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in biological processes including cell migration, cell adhesion and several pathways, mainly associated with extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathway in pancreatic cancer. The top hub genes, namely thrombospondin 1, DNA topoisomerase II alpha, syndecan 1, maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase and proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase Met were identified from the protein-protein interaction network. The expression levels of hub genes were consistent with data obtained in The Cancer Genome Atlas. DNA topoisomerase II alpha, syndecan 1, maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase and proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase Met were significantly linked with poor survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nThese hub genes may be used as potential targets for pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n","8":"\nTo better understand the molecular mechanisms and gene expression characteristics associated with development of bast fiber cell within flax stem phloem, the gene expression profiling of flax stem peels and leaves were screened, using Illumina's Digital Gene Expression (DGE) analysis. Four DGE libraries (2 for stem peel and 2 for leaf), ranging from 6.7 to 9.2 million clean reads were obtained, which produced 7.0 million and 6.8 million mapped reads for flax stem peel and leave, respectively. By differential gene expression analysis, a total of 975 genes, of which 708 (73%) genes have protein-coding annotation, were identified as phloem enriched genes putatively involved in the processes of polysaccharide and cell wall metabolism. Differential expression genes (DEGs) was validated using quantitative RT-PCR, the expression pattern of all nine genes determined by qRT-PCR fitted in well with that obtained by sequencing analysis. Cluster and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that a large number of genes related to metabolic process, catalytic activity and binding category were expressed predominantly in the stem peels. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the phloem enriched genes suggested approximately 111 biological pathways. The large number of genes and pathways produced from DGE sequencing will expand our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events in flax bast fiber development and provide a foundation for future studies on fiber development in other bast fiber crops.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Selection of suitable reference gene(s) for normalizations of RT-qPCR data is critical for reliable results. To date, reports on identification of suitable L. striatellus reference genes are still very limited. L. striatellus is a destructive rice pest and it can transmit multiple viruses, including Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), Rice stripe virus (RSV), and Maize rough dwarf virus (MRDV), to many important cereal crops worldwide. In this study, we examined the stablity of seven selected candidate reference genes in L. striatellus at different developmental stages, in different tissues, in RBSDV- or RSV-infected L. striatellus or in RBSDV-infected and Lssynaptojanin 1 (LsSYNJ1)-silenced L. striatellus. The RT-qPCR data representing individual candidate genes were analyzed using five different methods: the delta Ct method, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the RefFinder algorithm, respectively. The most stable reference gene for the specific condition was selected according to a comprehensive analysis using the RefFinder method. Ribosomal protein L5 (LsRPL5) and LsRPL8 are the most stably expressed genes in L. striatellus at different developmental stages. Alpha-1-tubulin (Ls\u03b1-TUB) is the most stably expressed reference gene in different tissues of RBSDV viruliferous (RBSDV-V) or non-viruliferous (RBSDV-NV) L. striatellus. LsRPL8 is the most stably expressed reference gene in RBSDV-V or RSV viruliferous (RSV-V) L. striatellus, while beta-tubulin (Ls\u03b2-TUB) is the most stably expressed reference gene in RBSDV-V and LsSYNJ1-silenced L. striatellus. The selected reference genes were further investigated during analyses of RBSDV P5-1 and P10 gene expression in different tissues from RBSDV-V or RBSDV-NV L. striatellus. The stably expressed reference genes identified in this study will benefit future gene function studies using L. striatellus.\n","10":"\nThe patenting of human genes has been the subject of debate for decades. While China has gradually come to play an important role in the global genomics-based testing and treatment market, little is known about Chinese scholars' perspectives on patent protection for human genes.\nA content analysis of academic literature was conducted to identify Chinese scholars' concerns regarding gene patents, including benefits and risks of patenting human genes, attitudes that researchers hold towards gene patenting, and any legal and policy recommendations offered for the gene patent regime in China.\n57.2% of articles were written by law professors, but scholars from health sciences, liberal arts, and ethics also participated in discussions on gene patent issues. While discussions of benefits and risks were relatively balanced in the articles, 63.5% of the articles favored gene patenting in general and, of the articles (n\u2009=\u200941) that explored gene patents in the Chinese context, 90.2% supported patent protections for human genes in China. The patentability of human genes was discussed in 33 articles, and 75.8% of these articles reached the conclusion that human genes are patentable.\nChinese scholars view the patent regime as an important legal tool to protect the interests of inventors and inventions as well as the genetic resources of China. As such, many scholars support a gene patent system in China. These attitudes towards gene patents remain unchanged following the court ruling in the Myriad case in 2013, but arguments have been raised about the scope of gene patents, in particular that the increasing numbers of gene patents may negatively impact public health in China.\n","11":"\nElymus sibiricus, which is a perennial and self-pollinated grass, is the typical species of the genus Elymus, which plays an important role in forage production and ecological restoration. No reports have, so far, systematically described the selection of optimal reference genes for reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis in E. sibiricus. The goals of this study were to evaluate the expression stability of 13 candidate reference genes in different experimental conditions, and to determine the appropriate reference genes for gene expression analysis in E. sibiricus. Five methods including Delta Ct (\u0394Ct), BestKeeper, NormFinder, geNorm, and RefFinder were used to assess the expression stability of 13 potential reference genes. The results of the RefFinder analysis showed that TBP2 and HIS3 were the most stable reference genes in different genotypes. TUA2 and PP2A had the most stable expression in different developmental stages. TBP2 and PP2A were suitable reference genes in different tissues. Under salt stress, ACT2 and TBP2 were identified as the most stable reference genes. ACT2 and TUA2 showed the most stability under heat stress. For cold stress, PP2A and ACT2 presented the highest degree of expression stability. DNAJ and U2AF were considered as the most stable reference genes under osmotic stress. The optimal reference genes were selected to investigate the expression pattern of target gene CSLE6 in different conditions. This study provides suitable reference genes for further gene expression analysis using RT-qPCR in E. sibiricus.\n","12":"\nImproved reproductive efficiency could lead to economic benefits for the beef industry, once the intensive selection pressure has led to a decreased fertility. However, several factors limit our understanding of fertility traits, including genetic differences between populations and statistical limitations. In the present study, the RNA-sequencing data from uterine samples of high-fertile (HF) and sub-fertile (SF) animals was integrated using co-expression network meta-analysis, weighted gene correlation network analysis, identification of upstream regulators, variant calling, and network topology approaches. Using this pipeline, top hub-genes harboring fixed variants (HF \u00d7 SF) were identified in differentially co-expressed gene modules (DcoExp). The functional prioritization analysis identified the genes with highest potential to be key-regulators of the DcoExp modules between HF and SF animals. Consequently, 32 functional candidate genes (10 upstream regulators and 22 top hub-genes of DcoExp modules) were identified. These genes were associated with the regulation of relevant biological processes for fertility, such as embryonic development, germ cell proliferation, and ovarian hormone regulation. Additionally, 100 candidate variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (INDELs)) were identified within those genes. In the long-term, the results obtained here may help to reduce the frequency of subfertility in beef herds, reducing the associated economic losses caused by this condition.\n","13":"\nThe analysis of transcript levels of specific genes is important for understanding transcriptional regulation and for the characterization of gene function. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a powerful tool to quantify gene expression. The objective of this study was to identify reliable housekeeping genes in Giardia lamblia. Twelve genes were selected for this purpose, and their expression was analyzed in the wild type WB strain and in two strains with resistance to nitazoxanide (NTZ) and metronidazole (MTZ), respectively. RefFinder software analysis showed that the expression of the genes is different in the three strains. The integrated data from the four analyses showed that the NADH oxidase (NADH) and aldolase (ALD) genes were the most steadily expressed genes, whereas the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was the most unstable. Additionally, the relative expression of seven genes were quantified in the NTZ- and MTZ-resistant strains by RT-qPCR, using the aldolase gene as the internal control, and the results showed a consistent differential pattern of expression in both strains. The housekeeping genes found in this work will facilitate the analysis of mRNA expression levels of other genes of interest in G. lamblia.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the interpretation of RT-qPCR results depends on the proper use of internal controls, i.e., reference genes. Japanese quail is an agronomic species also used as a laboratory model, but little is known about RT-qPCR reference genes for this species. Thus, we investigated 10 putative reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, PGK1, RPS7, RPS8, RPL19, RPL32, SDHA, TBP and YWHAZ) in three different female and male quail tissues (liver, brain and pectoral muscle). Gene expression stability was evaluated with three different algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. For each tissue, a suitable set of reference genes was defined and validated by a differential analysis of gene expression between females and males (CCNH in brain and RPL19 in pectoral muscle). Collectively, our study led to the identification of suitable reference genes in liver, brain and pectoral muscle for Japanese quail, along with recommendations for the identification of reference gene sets for this species.\n","15":"\nChinese cordyceps, also known as Chinese caterpillar fungus (Ophiocordyceps sinensis, syn. Cordyceps sinensis), is of particular interest for its cryptic life cycle and economic and ecological importance. The large-scale artificial cultivation was succeeded recently after several decades of efforts and attempts. However, the induction of primordium, sexual development of O. sinensis and the molecular basis of its lifestyle still remain cryptic.\nThe developmental transcriptomes were analyzed for six stages covering the whole developmental process, including hyphae (HY), sclerotium (ST), primordium (PR), young fruiting body (YF), developed fruiting body (DF) and mature fruiting body (MF), with a focus on the expression of sexual development-related genes. Principal component analysis revealed that the gene expression profiles at the stages of primordium formation and fruiting body development are more similar than those of the undifferentiated HY stage. The PR and MF stages grouped together, suggesting that primordium differentiation and sexual maturation have similar expression patterns. Many more DEGs were identified between the ST and HY stages, covering 47.5% of the O. sinensis genome, followed by the comparisons between the ST and PR stages. Using pairwise comparisons and weighted gene coexpression network analysis, modules of coexpressed genes and candidate hub genes for each developmental stage were identified. The four mating type loci genes expressed during primordium differentiation and sexual maturation; however, spatiotemporal specificity of gene expression indicated that they also expressed during the anamorphic HY stage. The four mating type genes were not coordinately expressed, suggesting they may have divergent roles. The expression of the four mating type genes was highest in the fertile part and lowest in the sclerotium of the MF stage, indicating that there is tissue specificity. Half of genes related to mating signaling showed as the highest expression in the ST stage, indicating fruiting was initiated in the ST stage.\nThese results provide a new perspective to understanding of the key pathways and hub genes, and sexual development-related gene profile in the development of Chinese cordyceps. It will be helpful for underlying sexual reproduction, and add new information to existing models of fruiting body development in edible fungi.\n","16":"\nNew genes are of recent origin and only present in a subset of species in a phylogeny. Accumulated evidence suggests that new genes, like old genes that are conserved across species, can also take on important functions and be essential for the survival and reproductive success of organisms. Although there are detailed analyses of the mechanisms underlying new genes' gaining fertility functions, how new genes rapidly become essential for viability remains unclear. We focused on a young retro-duplicated gene (CG7804, which we named Cocoon) in Drosophila that originated between 4 and 10 Ma. We found that, unlike its evolutionarily conserved parental gene, Cocoon has evolved under positive selection and accumulated many amino acid differences at functional sites from the parental gene. Despite its young age, Cocoon is essential for the survival of Drosophila melanogaster at multiple developmental stages, including the critical embryonic stage, and its expression is essential in different tissues from those of its parental gene. Functional genomic analyses found that Cocoon acquired unique DNA-binding sites and has a contrasting effect on gene expression to that of its parental gene. Importantly, Cocoon binding predominantly locates at genes that have other essential functions and\/or have multiple gene-gene interactions, suggesting that Cocoon acquired novel essential function to survival through forming interactions that have large impacts on the gene interaction network. Our study is an important step toward deciphering the evolutionary trajectory by which new genes functionally diverge from parental genes and become essential.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.

While many studies have reported a positive correlation between gene expression and promoter accessibility, few have investigated the genes that deviate from this trend. In this study, we aimed to understand the relationship between gene expression and promoter accessibility in multiple cell types while also identifying gene regulatory networks in the placenta, an understudied organ that is critical for a successful pregnancy.\nWe started by assaying the open chromatin landscape in the mid-gestation placenta, when the fetal vasculature has started developing. After incorporating transcriptomic data generated in the placenta at the same time point, we grouped genes based on their expression levels and ATAC-seq promoter coverage. We found that the genes with the strongest correlation (high expression and high coverage) are likely involved in housekeeping functions, whereas tissue-specific genes were highly expressed and had only medium-low coverage. We also predicted that genes with medium-low expression and high promoter coverage were actively repressed. Within this group, we extracted a protein-protein interaction network enriched for neuronal functions, likely preventing the cells from adopting a neuronal fate. We further confirmed that a repressive histone mark is bound to the promoters of genes in this network. Finally, we ran our pipeline using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data generated in ten additional cell types. We again found that genes with the strongest correlation are enriched for housekeeping functions and that genes with medium-low promoter coverage and high expression are more likely to be tissue-specific. These results demonstrate that only two data types, both of which require relatively low starting material to generate and are becoming more commonly available, can be integrated to understand multiple aspects of gene regulation.\nWithin the placenta, we identified an active placenta-specific gene network as well as a repressed neuronal network. Beyond the placenta, we demonstrate that ATAC-seq data and RNA-seq data can be integrated to identify tissue-specific genes and actively repressed gene networks in multiple cell types.\n","18":"\nValidation of suitable reference genes is critical in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Suitable and reliable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression data are characterized by high gene expression stability across tissues and different experimental conditions. This study evaluated the gene expression stability of ten reference genes commonly used in Arabidopsis thaliana for their suitability in qRT-PCR analysis in Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. The orthologous sequences of these ten candidate genes were identified from T. wilfordii transcriptomic data (Project No. SRX472292). Five algorithms including GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, \u0394Ct, and RefFinder were used to assess the gene expression stability of these putative reference genes in different plant tissues and different stress conditions. The results identified ACTINT7 and TBP as the most suitable reference genes across all samples. The gene expressions of TwHMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, KU246037.1) and of TwDXR (1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, KJ174341.1) were investigated to validate the suitability of the reference genes. The validation analysis confirmed the suitability of ACTINT7 and TBP as the best reference genes for elucidating secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathway in T. wilfordii. In summary, this study identified the most suitable and reliable reference genes for future qRT-PCR- based studies in T. wilfordii.\n","19":"\nAuricularia cornea Ehrenb., previously named A. polytricha (Mont.) Sacc, has become one of the most widely cultivated mushrooms in China. Considerable research has been conducted on its cultivation, pathogen identification, proteomics, and more. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been performed on reference-gene validation in this species. Formerly, reference genes were selected for their expression levels only relied upon from others species, owing to the fact that the gene stability in this species is unknown. In this study, nine candidate genes, including tubulin alpha-1A chain (TUBA1A), \u03b2-tubulin (Btu), phosphoglucomutase (Pgm), actin 1 (Act1), protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit (PP2A), polyubiquitin (UBQ), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), 18S ribosomal protein (18S) and 28S ribosomal protein (28S), were evaluated among different strains and developmental stages. Four algorithms (i.e., geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder) were used to analyze candidate genes. The results revealed that UBQ was the most stable reference gene, while 18S was the least stable. Despite these results, the candidate genes were largely inadequate and only two were considered suitable. Based on candidate gene stability, PP2A and UBQ were identified as a set of usable interior control genes for future analyses in this species. This is the first systematic study conducted for selecting reference genes in A. cornea, and lays the foundation for identifying genes and quantifying gene expression in this species.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019.

To date, WOX genes has been identified and analyzed in many polyploids (such as cotton and tobacco), but the evolutionary analysis of them during polyploidization is rare. With the completion of genome sequencing, allotetraploid Brassica napus and its diploid progenitors (B. rapa and B. oleracea) are a good system for studying this question.\nIn this study, 52, 25 and 29 WOX genes were identified in allotetraploid B. napus (2n\u2009=\u20094x\u2009=\u200938, AnCn), the An genome donor B. rapa (2n\u2009=\u20092x\u2009=\u200920, Ar) and the Cn genome donor B. oleracea (2n\u2009=\u20092x\u2009=\u200918, Co), respectively. All identified WOX genes in B. napus and its diploid progenitors were divided into three clades, and these genes were selected to perform gene structure and chromosome location analysis. The results showed that at least 70 and 67% of WOX genes maintained the same gene structure and relative position on chromosomes, respectively, indicating that WOX genes in B. napus were highly conserved at the DNA level during polyploidization. In addition, the analysis of duplicated genes and transposable elements (TEs) near WOX genes showed that whole-genome triplication (WGT) events, segmental duplication and abundant TEs played important roles in the expansion of the WOX gene family in B. napus. Moreover, the analysis of the expression profiles of WOX gene pairs with evolutionary relationships suggested that the WOX gene family may have changed at the transcriptional regulation level during polyploidization.\nThe results of this study increased our understanding of the WOX genes in B. napus and its diploid progenitors, providing a rich resource for further study of WOX genes in these species. In addition, the changes in WOX genes during the process of polyploidization were discussed from the aspects of gene number, gene structure, gene relative location and gene expression, which provides a reference for future polyploidization analysis.\n","21":"\nThe reliability of qRT-PCR results depend on the stability of reference genes used for normalization, suggesting the necessity of identification of reference genes before gene expression analysis. Morels are edible mushrooms well-known across the world and highly prized by many culinary kitchens.

The stability of the candidate genes was evaluated with geNorm and NormFinder under three different experimental conditions, and several genes with excellent stability were selected. The extensive adaptability of the selected genes was tested in ten Morchella species. Results from the three experimental conditions revealed that ACT1 and INTF7 were the most prominent genes in Morchella, CYC3 was the most stable gene in different development stages, INTF4\/AEF3 were the top-ranked genes across carbon sources, while INTF3\/CYC3 pair showed the robust stability for temperature stress treatment. We suggest using ACT1, AEF3, CYC3, INTF3, INTF4 and INTF7 as reference genes for gene expression analysis studies for any of the 10 Morchella strains tested in this study. The stability and practicality of the gene, vacuolar protein sorting (INTF3), vacuolar ATP synthase (INTF4) and14-3-3 protein (INTF7) involving the basic biological processes were validated for the first time as the candidate reference genes for quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the stability of the reference genes was found to vary under the three different experimental conditions, indicating the importance of identifying specific reference genes for particular conditions.\n","22":"\nSelection of informative genes from high dimensional gene expression data has emerged as an important research area in genomics. Many gene selection techniques have been proposed so far are either based on relevancy or redundancy measure. Further, the performance of these techniques has been adjudged through post selection classification accuracy computed through a classifier using the selected genes. This performance metric may be statistically sound but may not be biologically relevant. A statistical approach, i.e. Boot-MRMR, was proposed based on a composite measure of maximum relevance and minimum redundancy, which is both statistically sound and biologically relevant for informative gene selection. For comparative evaluation of the proposed approach, we developed two biological sufficient criteria, i.e. Gene Set Enrichment with QTL (GSEQ) and biological similarity score based on Gene Ontology (GO). Further, a systematic and rigorous evaluation of the proposed technique with 12 existing gene selection techniques was carried out using five gene expression datasets. This evaluation was based on a broad spectrum of statistically sound (e.g. subject classification) and biological relevant (based on QTL and GO) criteria under a multiple criteria decision-making framework. The performance analysis showed that the proposed technique selects informative genes which are more biologically relevant. The proposed technique is also found to be quite competitive with the existing techniques with respect to subject classification and computational time. Our results also showed that under the multiple criteria decision-making setup, the proposed technique is best for informative gene selection over the available alternatives. Based on the proposed approach, an R Package, i.e. BootMRMR has been developed and available at https:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/web\/packages\/BootMRMR.

However, in genome sequencing studies, the identification of disease genes among a candidate gene list is often difficult because of the large number of apparently damaging (but usually neutral) variants. A number of variant prioritization tools have been developed to help detect disease-causal sites. However, the results may be misleading as many variants scored as damaging by these tools are often tolerated, and there are inconsistencies in prediction results among the different variant-level prediction tools. Recently, studies have indicated that understanding gene properties might improve detection of genes liable to have associated disease variation and that this information improves molecular diagnostics. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate how understanding gene-specific properties might improve filtering strategies in clinical sequence data to prioritize potential disease variants. Improved understanding of the 'disease genome', which includes coding, noncoding and regulatory variation, might help resolve difficult cases. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of existing gene-level approaches, the relationships between measures of gene-pathogenicity and how use of these prediction tools can be developed for molecular diagnostics.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

Moreover the effect of heart failure on the expression of housekeeping genes in right and left ventricles is yet to be studied. Therefore we aim to provide stable housekeeping genes for both ventricles in heart failure and normal heart samples. In this study, we selected seven commonly used housekeeping genes as candidates. By using the qRT-PCR, the expression levels of ACTB, RAB7A, GAPDH, REEP5, RPL5, PSMB4 and VCP in eight heart failure and four normal heart samples were assessed. The stability of candidate housekeeping genes was evaluated by geNorm and Normfinder softwares. GAPDH showed the least variation in all heart samples. Results also indicated the difference of gene expression existed in heart failure left and right ventricles. GAPDH had the highest expression stability in both heart failure and normal heart samples. We also propose using different sets of housekeeping genes for left and right ventricles respectively. The combination of RPL5, GAPDH and PSMB4 is suitable for the right ventricle and the combination of GAPDH, REEP5 and RAB7A is suitable for the left ventricle.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To evaluate the expression stability of 12 candidate reference genes of C. elegans for exposing to different concentrations of Cry1Ia36 protein and different treat time, five statistical approaches (the comparative delta-Ct method, BestKeeper, NormFinder, Genorm and RefFinder) were used to evaluate each individual candidate reference gene. The results indicated that cdc-42 and F35G12.2 were the best reference genes for performing reliable gene expression normalization in the impact of Cry1Ia36 protein. In addition, when C. elegans was exposed to Cry1Ia36 protein and other nematicides, avermectin and 5-aminolevulinic acid, cdc-42 was recommended as the most reliable reference genes. Y45F10D.4 was the least stable reference genes in our experimental settings. Therefore, cdc-42 was reliable reference gene for gene expression studies in C. elegans exposed to Cry1Ia36 protein and other nematicides.\n","26":"\nPaeonia ostii seeds have recently been identified as a new source of \u03b1-linolenic acid in China. Studying the gene expression patterns of unsaturated fatty acid-related genes would be helpful for understanding the mechanism of \u03b1-linolenic acid accumulation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a useful method for reliably evaluating gene expression, and it is necessary to select reliable reference genes for data normalization in qRT-PCR analysis. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of 12 candidate reference genes using four mathematical algorithms (\u2206Ct, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and geNorm). The web-based tool RefFinder was used to integrate the results and to provide a comprehensive ranking order. The expression stability ranking orders of reference genes were different caculated by these four algorithms, and the ranking order analyzed by the RefFinder was UBQ\u2009>\u2009Tip41\u2009>\u2009UCE\u2009>\u2009EF-1\u03b1\u2009>\u2009\u03b1-TUB\u2009>\u2009PP2A\u2009>\u2009ACT\u2009>\u2009GAPDH\u2009>\u2009SAM\u2009>\u2009CYP\u2009>\u2009\u03b2-TUB\u2009>\u200918S at the different seed development stages, and UBQ\u2009>\u2009Tip41\u2009>\u2009EF-1\u03b1\u2009>\u2009\u03b1-TUB\u2009>\u2009PP2A\u2009>\u2009UCE\u2009>\u2009GAPDH\u2009>\u2009SAM\u2009>\u2009ACT\u2009>\u2009CYP\u2009>\u200918S\u2009>\u2009\u03b2-TUB in P. ostii tissues.

However, little is known about the key genes and corresponding expression profiling involved in the biosynthesis pathways of these ingredients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a powerful, commonly-used method for gene expression analysis, but the accuracy of the quantitative data produced depends on the appropriate selection of reference genes.\nIn this study, the systematic analysis of the reference genes was performed for quantitative real-Time PCR normalization in I. indigotica. We selected nine candidate reference genes, including six traditional housekeeping genes (ACT, \u03b1-TUB, \u03b2-TUB, UBC, CYP, and EF1-\u03b1), and three newly stable internal control genes (MUB, TIP41, and RPL) from a transcriptome dataset of I. indigotica, and evaluated their expression stabilities in different tissues (root, stem, leaf, and petiole) and leaves exposed to three abiotic treatments (low-nitrogen, ABA, and MeJA) using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comprehensive RefFind algorithms. The results demonstrated that MUB and EF1-\u03b1 were the two most stable reference genes for all samples. TIP41 as the optimal reference gene for low-nitrogen stress and MeJA treatment, while ACT had the highest ranking for ABA treatment and CYP was the most suitable for different tissues.\nThe results revealed that the selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for normalizing data is mandatory to acquire accurate quantification results. The necessity of specific internal control for specific conditions was also emphasized. Furthermore, this work will provide valuable information to enhance further research in gene function and molecular biology on I. indigotica and other related species.\n","28":"\nWRKY transcription factors (TFs), one of the ten largest TF families in higher plants, play important roles in regulating plant development and resistance. To date, little is known about the WRKY TF family in Brassica oleracea. Recently, the completed genome sequence of cabbage (B. oleracea var. capitata) allows us to systematically analyze WRKY genes in this species. A total of 148 WRKY genes were characterized and classified into seven subgroups that belong to three major groups. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses revealed that the repertoire of cabbage WRKY genes was derived from a common ancestor shared with Arabidopsis thaliana. The B. oleracea WRKY genes were found to be preferentially retained after the whole-genome triplication (WGT) event in its recent ancestor, suggesting that the WGT event had largely contributed to a rapid expansion of the WRKY gene family in B. oleracea. The analysis of RNA-Seq data from various tissues (i.e., roots, stems, leaves, buds, flowers and siliques) revealed that most of the identified WRKY genes were positively expressed in cabbage, and a large portion of them exhibited patterns of differential and tissue-specific expression, demonstrating that these gene members might play essential roles in plant developmental processes. Comparative analysis of the expression level among duplicated genes showed that gene expression divergence was evidently presented among cabbage WRKY paralogs, indicating functional divergence of these duplicated WRKY genes. \nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the de novo assembly of the Populus deltoides genome, all of the detected major genetic loci conferring resistance to M. larici-populina were confined to a 3.5-Mb region on chromosome 19. The transcriptomes of the resistant and susceptible genotypes were sequenced for a timespan from 0 to 168 hours postinoculation. By mapping the differentially expressed genes to the target genomic region, we identified two constitutive expression R genes and one inducible expression R gene that might confer resistance to M. larici-populina. Nucleotide variations were predicted based on the reconstructed haplotypes for each allele of the candidate genes. We also confirmed that salicylic acid was the phytohormone mediating signal transduction pathways, and PR-1 was identified as a key gene inhibiting rust reproduction. Finally, quantitative reverse transcription PCR assay revealed consistent expressions with the RNA-sequencing data for the detected key genes. This study presents an efficient approach for the identification of particular genes underlying phenotype of interest by the combination of genetic mapping, transcriptome profiling, and candidate gene sequences dissection. The identified key genes would be useful for host resistance diagnosis and for molecular breeding of elite poplar cultivars exhibiting resistance to M. larici-populina infection. The detected R genes are also valuable for testing whether the combination of individual R genes can induce durable quantitative resistance.\n","30":"\nThe marine dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium, is a well-known photosynthetic partner for coral and other diverse, non-photosynthetic hosts in subtropical and tropical shallows, where it comprises an essential component of marine ecosystems. Using molecular phylogenetics, the genus Symbiodinium has been classified into nine major clades, A-I, and one of the reported differences among phenotypes is their capacity to synthesize mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), which absorb UV radiation. However, the genetic basis for this difference in synthetic capacity is unknown. To understand genetics underlying Symbiodinium diversity, we report two draft genomes, one from clade A, presumed to have been the earliest branching clade, and the other from clade C, in the terminal branch.\nThe nuclear genome of Symbiodinium clade A (SymA) has more gene families than that of clade C, with larger numbers of organelle-related genes, including mitochondrial transcription terminal factor (mTERF) and Rubisco. While clade C (SymC) has fewer gene families, it displays specific expansions of repeat domain-containing genes, such as leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and retrovirus-related dUTPases. Interestingly, the SymA genome encodes a gene cluster for MAA biosynthesis, potentially transferred from an endosymbiotic red alga (probably of bacterial origin), while SymC has completely lost these genes.\nOur analysis demonstrates that SymC appears to have evolved by losing gene families, such as the MAA biosynthesis gene cluster. In contrast to the conservation of genes related to photosynthetic ability, the terminal clade has suffered more gene family losses than other clades, suggesting a possible adaptation to symbiosis. Overall, this study implies that Symbiodinium ecology drives acquisition and loss of gene families.\n","31":"\nRelative gene expression analyses by RT-qPCR (reverse transcription-quantitative PCR) are highly dependent on the reference genes in normalizing the expression data of target genes. Therefore, inappropriate endogenous control genes will lead to inaccurate target gene expression profiles, and the selection and validation of suitable internal reference genes becomes essential. In this study, we retrieved the commonly used reference genes in transcriptome datasets of Codonopsis pilosula by RNA-Seq (unpublished data), and selected 15 candidate reference genes according to the coefficient of variation (CV) and fold change (FC) value of gene expression. The expression levels of candidate reference genes, which is at different growth stages, undergoing cold stress and drought stress, was determined by RT-qPCR. The expression stability of these genes was evaluated using software packages and algorithms including \u0394Ct, geNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper. Then appropriate reference genes were screened and validated by target gene-UDGPase (UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase). The optimal RGs combinations of C. pilosula, including PP2A59\u03b3, CPY20-1, UBCE32, RPL5B and UBC18 for developmental stage, RPL5B, RPL13 and PP2A59\u03b3 for cold treatment, RPL13 and PP2A59\u03b3 for drought treatment, were found and proposed as reference genes for future work.

Afterwards, the integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression profiling was used to screen crucial genes. In addition, we used RT-PCR and MSP to verify the expression levels and methylation status of these crucial genes in 20 synovial biopsy samples obtained from 10 RA model mice and 10 normal mice. BCL11B, CCDC88C, FCRLA and APOL6 were both up-regulated and hypomethylated in RA according to integrated analysis, RT-PCR and MSP verification.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a powerful approach for investigating target genes expression profiles at the transcriptional level. However, the identification and selection of internal reference genes, which is often overlooked, is the most vital step before the analysis of target gene expression by qRT-PCR. So far, the reliable internal reference genes under a certain condition of D. caesalis have not been investigated. Therefore, this study evaluated the expression stability of eight candidate reference genes including ACT, \u03b2-TUB, GAPDH, G6PDH, RPS3a, RPL13a, EF1\u03b1, and EIF4A in different developmental stages, tissues and sexes using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper algorithms. To verify the stability of the recommended internal reference genes, the expression levels of DcaeOBP5 were analyzed under different treatment conditions. The results indicated that ACT, RPL13a, \u03b2-TUB, RPS3a, and EF1\u03b1 were identified as the most stable reference genes for further studies on target gene expression involving different developmental stages of D. caesalis. And ACT and EIF4A were recommended as stable reference genes for different tissues. Furthermore, ACT, EF1\u03b1, and RPS3a were ranked as the best reference genes in different sexes based on three algorithms. Our research represents the critical first step to normalize qRT-PCR data and ensure the accuracy of expression of target genes involved in phylogenetic and physiological mechanism at the transcriptional level in D. caesalia.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

We targeted constitutively expressed genes encoding calnexin (CNX), protein disulphide isomerase (PDIL1-1) and luminal binding protein (BiP1); an endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible gene (OsbZIP50); and genes with seed-specific expression encoding \u03b1-globulin (Glb-1) and glutelin-B4 (GluB4). TGS of four genes was obtained with high efficiency (CNX, 66.7% of regenerated plants; OsBiP1, 67.4%; OsbZIP50, 63.4%; GluB4, 66.1%), whereas the efficiency was lower for PDIL1-1 (33.3%) and Glb-1 TGS lines (10.5%). The heredity of TGS, methylation levels of promoter regions and specificity of silencing of the target gene were investigated in some of the TGS lines. In progeny of CNX and OsbZIP50 TGS lines, suppression of the target genes was preserved (except in the endosperm) even after the removal of trigger genes (T-DNA) by segregation. TGS of CNX was reverted by demethylation treatment, and a significant difference in CG and CHG methylation levels in the -1 to -250\u00a0bp region of the CNX promoter was detected between the TGS and revertant lines, suggesting that TGS is closely related to the methylation levels of promoter. TGS exhibited specific suppression towards the target gene compared with post-transcriptional gene silencing when GluB4 gene from glutelin multigene family was targeted. Based on these results, future perspectives and problems to be solved in the application of RdDM to new plant breeding techniques in rice are discussed.\n\u00a9 2018 The Authors.

To better understand the underlying mechanism, five related datasets deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus were included in the present study. The Bioconductor 'limma' package was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the 'Weighted Gene Co\u2011expression Network Analysis' package was used to construct a weighted gene co\u2011expression network to identify key modules and hub genes, associated with OS. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes overrepresentation analyses were used for functional annotation. The results indicated that 1,405 genes were dysregulated in OS, including 927 upregulated and 478 downregulated genes, when the cut off value was set at a \u22652 fold\u2011change and an adjusted P\u2011value of P<0.01 was used. Functional annotation of DEGs indicated that these genes were involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and that they function in several processes, including biological adhesion, ECM organization, cell migration and leukocyte migration. These findings suggested that dysregulation of the ECM shaped the tumor microenvironment and modulated the OS hallmark. Genes assigned to the yellow module were positively associated with OS and could contribute to the development of OS. In conclusion, the present study has identified several key genes that are potentially druggable genes or therapeutics targets in OS. Functional annotations revealed that the dysregulation of the ECM may contribute to OS development and, therefore, provided new insights to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying OS.\n","36":"\nPlants constantly fight with stressful factors as high or low temperature, drought, soil salinity and flooding. Plants have evolved a set of stress response mechanisms, which involve physiological and biochemical changes that result in adaptive or morphological changes. At a molecular level, stress response in plants is performed by genetic networks, which also undergo changes in the process of evolution. The study of the network structure and evolution may highlight mechanisms of plants adaptation to adverse conditions, as well as their response to stresses and help in discovery and functional characterization of the stress-related genes. We performed an analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana genes associated with several types of abiotic stresses (heat, cold, water-related, light, osmotic, salt, and oxidative) at the network level using a phylostratigraphic approach. Our results show that a substantial fraction of genes associated with various types of abiotic stress is of ancient origin and evolves under strong purifying selection. The interaction networks of genes associated with stress response have a modular structure with a regulatory component being one of the largest for five of seven stress types. We demonstrated a positive relationship between the number of interactions of gene in the stress gene network and its age. Moreover, genes of the same age tend to be connected in stress gene networks. We also demonstrated that old stress-related genes usually participate in the response for various types of stress and are involved in numerous biological processes unrelated to stress. Our results demonstrate that the stress response genes represent the ancient and one of the fundamental molecular systems in plants.\n","37":"\nLigon lintless-1 (Li1) is a monogenic dominant mutant of Gossypium hirsutum (upland cotton) with a phenotype of impaired vegetative growth and short lint fibers. Despite years of research involving genetic mapping and gene expression profile analysis of Li1 mutant ovule tissues, the gene remains uncloned and the underlying pathway of cotton fiber elongation is still unclear. In this study, we report the whole genome-level deep-sequencing analysis of leaf tissues of the Li1 mutant. Differentially expressed genes in leaf tissues of mutant versus wild-type (WT) plants are identified, and the underlying pathways and potential genes that control leaf and fiber development are inferred. The results show that transcription factors AS2, YABBY5, and KANDI-like are significantly differentially expressed in mutant tissues compared with WT ones. Interestingly, several fiber development-related genes are found in the downregulated gene list of the mutant leaf transcriptome. These genes include heat shock protein family, cytoskeleton arrangement, cell wall synthesis, energy, H2O2 metabolism-related genes, and WRKY transcription factors. This finding suggests that the genes are involved in leaf morphology determination and fiber elongation. The expression data are also compared with the previously published microarray data of Li1 ovule tissues. Comparative analysis of the ovule transcriptomes of Li1 and WT reveals that a number of pathways important for fiber elongation are enriched in the downregulated gene list at different fiber development stages (0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18dpa). Differentially expressed genes identified in both leaf and fiber samples are aligned with cotton whole genome sequences and combined with the genetic fine mapping results to identify a list of candidate genes for Li1.\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Different abiotic stress conditions like drought, salt, heat and cold stress adversely affect the productivity and quality of mulberry leaves. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) is a reliable and widely used method to identify abiotic stress responsive genes and molecular mechanism in different plant species. Selection of suitable reference genes is important requirement for normalizing the expression of genes through qRT-PCR study. In the present study, we have selected eight candidate reference genes in mulberry for analyzing their expression stability in different abiotic stress treatments including drought, salt, heat and cold stresses. The expression stability of these reference genes was determined using geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder statistical algorithms. The results showed that Ubiquitin and protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit A (PP2A) were the most stable genes across all the treatment samples. However, analysis of individual stresses revealed different expression profiles and stability of reference genes. Actin3 and PP2A were most stable in drought and salt conditions respectively. RPL3 most preferred in heat stress and Ubiquitin was most stable in cold stress. We propose the ubiquitin and PP2A are the preferred reference genes for normalization of gene expression data from abiotic stresses.

These genes were divided into six subgroups: PEPC-i, PEPC-ii, PEPC-iii, PEPC-iv, PEPC-v and PEPC-vi; PEPC genes in each subgroup displayed conserved gene structure and motifs. Segmental duplication and whole genome duplication (WGD) events yielded the expansion of PEPC genes. Expression assays showed that the duplicated PEPC genes displayed diverse expression patterns, indicating that they experienced functional divergence. Of which, genes in PEPC-iv subgroup played crucial role for substrate distribution in cottonseed. Cis-elements, putative miRNAs and expression analyses showed that GhPEPC homologs might respond to abiotic stresses, expression levels of GhPEPC1 and GhPEPC2\/GhPEPC2D genes were larger induced than other GhPEPC genes under cold, heat, salt, and drought stresses, indicating the crucial roles in abiotic stresses response.

Recent guidelines have specified that a minimum of two validated reference genes should be used for normalisation. However, a quantitative review of the literature showed that the average number of reference genes used across all studies was 1.2. Thus, the vast majority of studies continue to use a single gene, with \u03b2-actin (ACTB) and\/or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) being commonly selected in studies of vertebrate gene expression. Few studies (15%) tested a panel of potential reference genes for stability of expression before using them to normalise data. Amongst studies specifically testing reference gene stability, few found ACTB or GAPDH to be optimal, whereby these genes were significantly less likely to be chosen when larger panels of potential reference genes were screened. Fewer reference genes were tested for stability in non-model organisms, presumably owing to a dearth of available primers in less well characterised species. Furthermore, the experimental conditions under which real-time quantitative PCR analyses were conducted had a large influence on the choice of reference genes, whereby different studies of rat brain tissue showed different reference genes to be the most stable. These results highlight the importance of validating the choice of normalising reference genes before conducting gene expression studies. \n","42":"\nThe current classification of angiosperms is based primarily on concatenated plastid markers and maximum likelihood (ML) inference. This approach has been justified by the assumption that plastid DNA (ptDNA) is inherited as a single locus and that its individual genes produce congruent trees. However, structural and functional characteristics of ptDNA suggest that plastid genes may not evolve as a single locus and are experiencing different evolutionary forces. To examine this idea, we produced new complete plastid genome (plastome) sequences of 27 species and combined these data with publicly available sequences to produce a final dataset that includes 78 plastid genes for 89 species of rosids and five outgroups. We used four data matrices (i.e., gene, exon, codon-aligned, and amino acid) to infer species and gene trees using ML and multispecies coalescent (MSC) methods. Rosids include about one third of all angiosperms and their two major clades, fabids and malvids, were recovered in almost all analyses. However, we detected incongruence between species trees inferred with different matrices and methods and previously published plastid and nuclear phylogenies. We visualized and tested the significance of incongruence between gene trees and species trees. We then measured the distribution of phylogenetic signal across sites and genes supporting alternative placements of five controversial nodes at different taxonomic levels. Gene trees inferred with plastid data often disagree with species trees inferred using both ML (with unpartitioned or partitioned data) and MSC. Species trees inferred with both methods produced alternative topologies for a few taxa. Our results show that, in a phylogenetic context, plastid protein-coding genes may not be fully linked and behaving as a single locus. Furthermore, concatenated matrices may produce highly supported phylogenies that are discordant with individual gene trees. We also show that phylogenies inferred with MSC are accurate. We therefore emphasize the importance of considering variation in phylogenetic signal across plastid genes and the exploration of plastome data to increase accuracy of estimating relationships. We also support the use of MSC with plastome matrices in future phylogenomic investigations.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Normalization to appropriate stably-expressed reference genes is essential for accurate quantitative measurement, but determination of such genes is challenging: healthy and dystrophic muscles present very different transcriptional environments, further altering with disease progression and muscle use, raising the possibility that no single gene or combination of genes may be stable under all experimental comparative scenarios. Despite the pedigree of this animal model, this problem remains unaddressed. The aim of this work was therefore to comprehensively assess reference gene suitability in the muscles of healthy and dystrophic mice, identifying reference genes appropriate for specific experimental comparisons, and determining whether an essentially universally-applicable set of genes exists. Using a large sample collection comprising multiple muscles (including the tibialis anterior, diaphragm and heart muscles) taken from healthy and mdx mice at three disease-relevant ages, and a panel of sixteen candidate reference genes (FBXO38, FBXW2, MON2, ZFP91, HTATSF1, GAPDH, ACTB, 18S, CDC40, SDHA, RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1, PAK1IP1, B2M and HPRT1), we used the geNorm, BestKeeper and Normfinder algorithms to identify genes that were stable under multiple possible comparative scenarios. We reveal that no single gene is stable under all conditions, but a normalization factor derived from multiple genes (RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1 and the widely-used ACTB) appears suitable for normalizing gene expression in both healthy and dystrophic mouse muscle regardless of muscle type or animal age. We further show that other popular reference genes, including GAPDH, are markedly disease- or muscle-type correlated. This study demonstrates the importance of empirical reference gene identification, and should serve as a valuable resource for investigators wishing to study gene expression in mdx mice.\n","44":"\nWhenever gene expression is being examined, it is essential that a normalization process is carried out to eliminate non-biological variations. The use of reference genes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actin, and ribosomal protein genes, is the usual method of choice for normalizing gene expression. Although reference genes are used to normalize target gene expression, a major problem is that the stability of these genes differs among tissues, developmental stages, species, and responses to abiotic factors. Therefore, the use and validation of multiple reference genes are required. This review discusses the reasons that why RT-qPCR has become the preferred method for validating results of gene expression profiles, the use of specific and non-specific dyes and the importance of use of primers and probes for qPCR as well as to discuss several statistical algorithms developed to help the validation of potential reference genes.

Furthermore, the hydrological genes were identified following the theory of biological genes, while their inheritance bases and variability bases were determined based on composition of hydrological series under diffe-rent time scales. To identify and test the components of hydrological genes, we constructed a diagnosis system of hydrological genes.

We estimated a lower limit of their genomic distances at the time they were transferred to their host genomes; this distribution shows a sharp upper bound at 30\u2009kb. The same gene-pairs can have larger distances (up to 70\u2009kb) in other genomes. These more distant pairs likely represent recent acquisitions via transduction that involve the co-transfer of excised prophage genes, as they are almost always associated with intervening phage-associated genes. The observed distribution of genomic distances of co-transferred genes is much broader than expected from a model based on the co-transfer of genes within operons; instead, this distribution is highly consistent with the size distribution of supra-operonic clusters (SOCs), groups of co-occurring and co-functioning genes that extend beyond operons. Thus, we propose that SOCs form a basic unit of horizontal gene transfer.\n","48":"\nMacrophages are key players in the initiation, perpetuation and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. They largely perform these roles through modulation of the expression of genes, especially those encoding cytokines. Murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) are commonly used as a model macrophage population for the study of immune responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli, notably lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which may be pertinent to the human situation. Evaluation of the temporal responses of LPS stimulated macrophages is widely conducted via the measurement of gene expression levels by RT-qPCR. While providing a robust and sensitive measure of gene expression levels, RT-qPCR relies on the normalisation of gene expression data to a stably expressed reference gene. Generally, a normalisation gene(s) is selected from a list of \"traditional\" reference genes without validation of expression stability under the specific experimental conditions of the study. In the absence of such validation, and given that many studies use only a single reference gene, the reliability of data is questionable.\nThe stability of expression levels of eight commonly used reference genes was assessed during the peak (6\u00a0h) and resolution (24\u00a0h) phases of the BMDM response to LPS. Further, this study identified two additional genes, which have not previously been described as reference genes, and the stability of their expression levels during the same phases of the inflammatory response were validated. Importantly, this study demonstrates that certain \"traditional\" reference genes are in fact regulated by LPS exposure, and, therefore, are not reliable candidates as their inclusion may compromise the accuracy of data interpretation. Testament to this, this study shows that the normalisation of gene expression data using an unstable reference gene greatly affects the experimental data obtained, and, therefore, the ultimate biological conclusions drawn.\nThis study reaffirms the importance of validating reference gene stability for individual experimental conditions. Given that gene expression levels in LPS stimulated macrophages is routinely used to infer biological phenomena that are of relevance to human conditions, verification of reference gene expression stability is crucial.\n","49":"\nThe aim of this work is to study the effect of the thermal stress of ambient temperature during winter and summer on the expression of type IV antifreeze gene (ANF IV) in different tissues of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as well as some immune-related genes. At first, genomic ANF IV gene was characterized from one fish; 124 amino acids were identified with 92.7% similarity with that on the gene bank. Expression of ANF IV and immune-related genes were done twice, once at the end of December (winter sample, temperature 14\u00a0\u00b0C) and the other at August (summer sample, temperature 36\u00a0\u00b0C). Assessment of ANF IV gene expression in different organs of fish was done; splenic mRNA was used for assessment of immune-related gene transcripts (CXCl2 chemokine, cc-chemokine, INF-3A, and MHC II\u03b2). Winter expression analysis of AFP IV in O. niloticus revealed significant upregulation of mRNA transcript levels in the intestine, gills, skin, spleen, liver, and brain with 324.03-, 170.06-, 107.63-, 97.61-, 94.35-, and 27.85-folds, respectively. Furthermore, upregulation in the gene was observed in some organs during summer: in the liver, gills, skin, intestine, and brain with lower levels compared with winter. The level of expression of immune-related genes in winter is significantly higher than summer in all assessed genes. Cc-chemokine gene expression was the most affected in both winter and summer. Variable expression profile of ANF IV in different organs and in different seasons together with its amino acid similarity of N-terminal and C-terminal with apolipoprotein (lipid binder) and form of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) suggests a different role for this protein which may be related to lipid metabolism.\n","50":"\nTranscriptional target genes show functional enrichment of genes. However, how many and how significantly transcriptional target genes include functional enrichments are still unclear. To address these issues, I predicted human transcriptional target genes using open chromatin regions, ChIP-seq data and DNA binding sequences of transcription factors in databases, and examined functional enrichment and gene expression level of putative transcriptional target genes.\nGene Ontology annotations showed four times larger numbers of functional enrichments in putative transcriptional target genes than gene expression information alone, independent of transcriptional target genes. To compare the number of functional enrichments of putative transcriptional target genes between cells or search conditions, I normalized the number of functional enrichment by calculating its ratios in the total number of transcriptional target genes. With this analysis, native putative transcriptional target genes showed the largest normalized number of functional enrichments, compared with target genes including 5-60% of randomly selected genes. The normalized number of functional enrichments was changed according to the criteria of enhancer-promoter interactions such as distance from transcriptional start sites and orientation of CTCF-binding sites. Forward-reverse orientation of CTCF-binding sites showed significantly higher normalized number of functional enrichments than the other orientations. Journal papers showed that the top five frequent functional enrichments were related to the cellular functions in the three cell types. The median expression level of transcriptional target genes changed according to the criteria of enhancer-promoter assignments (i.e. interactions) and was correlated with the changes of the normalized number of functional enrichments of transcriptional target genes.\nHuman putative transcriptional target genes showed significant functional enrichments. Functional enrichments were related to the cellular functions. The normalized number of functional enrichments of human putative transcriptional target genes changed according to the criteria of enhancer-promoter assignments and correlated with the median expression level of the target genes. These analyses and characters of human putative transcriptional target genes would be useful to examine the criteria of enhancer-promoter assignments and to predict the novel mechanisms and factors such as DNA binding proteins and DNA sequences of enhancer-promoter interactions.\n","51":"\nA well-known limit of genome browsers is that the large amount of genome and gene data is not organized in the form of a searchable database, hampering full management of numerical data and free calculations. Due to the continuous increase of data deposited in genomic repositories, their content revision and analysis is recommended. Using GeneBase, a software with a graphical interface able to import and elaborate National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene database entries, we provide tabulated spreadsheets updated to 2019 about human nuclear protein-coding gene data set ready to be used for any type of analysis about genes, transcripts and gene organization.\nComparison with previous reports reveals substantial change in the number of known nuclear protein-coding genes (now 19,116), the protein-coding non-redundant transcriptome space [now 59,281,518 base pair (bp), 10.1% increase], the number of exons (now 562,164, 36.2% increase) due to a relevant increase of the RNA isoforms recorded. Other parameters such as gene, exon or intron mean and extreme length appear to have reached a stability that is unlikely to be substantially modified by human genome data updates, at least regarding protein-coding genes. Finally, we confirm that there are no human introns shorter than 30\u00a0bp.\n","52":"\nMyxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are interferon (IFN)-inducible Dynamin-like GTPases, which play an important role in antiviral immunity. Three Mx genes (Mx1-3) have been cloned previously in rainbow trout. In this study, an additional six Mx genes were cloned that reside in four chromosomal loci. Further bioinformatics analysis suggests the presence of three teleost Mx groups (TMG) each with a characteristic gene organisation. Salmonid Mx belong to TMG1 and TMG2. The increased salmonid Mx gene copies are due mainly to local gene duplications that happened before and after salmonid speciation, in a lineage\/species specific manner. Trout Mx molecules have been diversified in the loop 1 and 4 regions, and in the nuclear localisation signal in loop 4. The trout Mx genes were shown to be differentially expressed in tissues, with high levels of expression of TMG1 (Mx1-4) in blood and TMG2 (Mx5-9) in intestine. The expression of the majority of the trout Mx genes was induced by poly IC in vitro and in vivo, and increased during development. In addition, induction by antiviral (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines was studied, and showed that type I IFN, IFN\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2 can induce Mx gene expression in an Mx gene-, cytokine- and cell line-dependent manner. These results show that salmonids possess a large number Mx genes as well as complex regulatory pathways, which may contribute to their success in an anadromous life style.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of a literature review, eight genes were selected: Actb, B2m, Hprt1, Ppia, Rplp0, Rpl13a, Rpl5, and Ywhaz. Genes were ranked according to their stability under different culture conditions as assessed using GenNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder algorithms. Although the employed algorithms returned different rankings, the most frequently top-ranked genes were: B2m and\/or Ppia for all 28day treatments (ALL28); Ppia and Hprt1 (adipogenic differentiation; A28), B2m (chondrogenic differentiation; C28), Rpl5 (controls maintained in complete culture medium; CCM), Rplp0 (osteogenic differentiation for 3days; O3), Rpl13a and Actb (osteogenic differentiation for 7days; O7), Rplp0 and Ppia (osteogenic differentiation for 14days; O14), Hprt1 and Ppia (osteogenic differentiation for 28days; O28), as well as Actb (all osteogenesis time points combined; ALLOSTEO). The obtained results indicate that the performance of reference genes depends on the differentiation protocol and on the analysis time, thus providing valuable information for the design of RT-PCR experiments.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016.

It is also present in the striated muscles of Amphioxus, an invertebrate cephalochordate that is phylogenetically close to vertebrates. However, the nebulin of urochordate ascidians or its expression in invertebrate hearts has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the structure and cardiac expression of the nebulin gene in Ciona intestinalis, a urochordate whose phylogeny lies between cephalochordates and vertebrates. As a result of the gene structure analysis, we found that the Ciona nebulin gene predicted to be 62\u202fkb and consists of 143 exons. The nebulin was expected to consist of a unique N-terminal region, followed by 155 nebulin repeats, another unique region, a Ser-rich region and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments showed that the Ciona nebulin gene was expressed in a variety of muscles, including hearts. However, Western blot analysis using antibody to Ciona nebulin did not detect the presence of full-length nebulin. Alternatively, RT-PCR experiments on samples of Ciona heart detected the expression of nebulette-like and nrap-like isoforms from the Ciona nebulin gene. These results indicate that, similarly to vertebrate hearts, Ciona hearts do not express nebulin, but rather nrap- and nebulette-like isoforms. These results also imply that the nebulin, nebulette and nrap genes in vertebrates were separated from an ancestral invertebrate nebulin gene during vertebrate evolution.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A total of three gene datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including GSE107943, GSE119336 and GSE26566. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues and adjacent liver tissues were identified using GSE107943, while tissue specific genes between bile duct and liver tissues were identified using GSE26566. Following the removal of tissue-specific genes, real DEGs were used to construct the WGCNA to investigate the association between gene modules and clinical traits. Following functional analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed, hub genes were selected and their diagnostic value was verified in GSE119336 using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Finally, the protein levels of the hub genes were also verified in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues. A total of 1,643 real DEGs were identified and used to construct the WGCNA. Additionally, a total of seven co-expressed gene modules were identified following WGCNA, while genes in brown and yellow modules were identified to be associated with multiple clinical traits (the number of clinical traits >3) and used as key modules. A total of 63 core key module genes were subsequently identified, and it was indicated that these genes were most enriched in the nucleus (Gene Ontology term) and the cell cycle pathway (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes term). Finally, a total of eight genes, including cyclin B1, cell division cycle 20, cell division cycle associated 8, cyclin dependent kinase 1, centrosomal protein 55, kinesin family member 2C, DNA topoisomerase II\u03b1 and TPX2 microtubule nucleation factor, exhibited the highest score in PPI analysis and had a high diagnostic value for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, the protein levels of these genes were also revealed to be increased in most intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues.

Despite its agronomical importance, some newly-emerging pathotypes often overcome race-specific disease resistance rapidly. It is thus desirable to develop a novel strategy for the long-lasting resistance of rice plants to ever-changing fungal pathogens. Brome mosaic virus (BMV)-induced RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a useful tool to study host-resistance genes for rice blast protection. Planta-generated silencing of targeted genes inside biotrophic pathogens can be achieved by expression of M.oryzae-derived gene fragments in the BMV-mediated gene silencing system, a technique termed host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). In this study, the effectiveness of BMV-mediated HIGS in M.oryzae was examined by targeting three predicted pathogenicity genes, MoABC1,MoMAC1 and MoPMK1. Systemic generation of fungal gene-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules induced by inoculation of BMV viral vectors inhibited disease development and reduced the transcription of targeted fungal genes after subsequent M.oryzae inoculation. Combined introduction of fungal gene sequences in sense and antisense orientation mediated by the BMV silencing vectors significantly enhanced the efficiency of this host-generated trans-specific RNAi, implying that these fungal genes played crucial roles in pathogenicity. Collectively, our results indicated that BMV-HIGS system was a great strategy for protecting host plants against the invasion of pathogenic fungi.\n","57":"\nAs invasive species have successfully colonized a wide range of dramatically different local environments, they offer a good opportunity to study interactions between species and rapidly changing environments. Gene expression represents one of the primary and crucial mechanisms for rapid adaptation to local environments. Here, we aim to select reference genes for quantitative gene expression analysis based on quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) for a model invasive ascidian, Ciona savignyi. We analyzed the stability of ten candidate reference genes in three tissues (siphon, pharynx and intestine) under two key environmental stresses (temperature and salinity) in the marine realm based on three programs (geNorm, NormFinder and delta Ct method). Our results demonstrated only minor difference for stability rankings among the three methods. The use of different single reference gene might influence the data interpretation, while multiple reference genes could minimize possible errors. Therefore, reference gene combinations were recommended for different tissues - the optimal reference gene combination for siphon was RPS15 and RPL17 under temperature stress, and RPL17, UBQ and TubA under salinity treatment; for pharynx, TubB, TubA and RPL17 were the most stable genes under temperature stress, while TubB, TubA and UBQ were the best under salinity stress; for intestine, UBQ, RPS15 and RPL17 were the most reliable reference genes under both treatments. Our results suggest that the necessity of selection and test of reference genes for different tissues under varying environmental stresses. The results obtained here are expected to reveal mechanisms of gene expression-mediated invasion success using C. savignyi as a model species. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Also the gene expression profile data and clinical information of the BRCA2 mutation group and non-BRCA2 mutation group were downloaded.\nThe prognosis of the BRCA2 mutation group was better than that of the non-mutant group. Among the down-regulated genes, the following genes showed significant differences between the two groups: CCL22, CYP2B6, CYP2E1, CYP4F2, HTR1E, HTR1F, KLRC1, NAPSA, SELL, SFTPA1, SFTPA2, SFTPB, SFTPC and STRA8, while the following genes among the up-regulated genes showed significant differences between the two groups: ELAVL3, NOTUM, TRH and VIP. Meanwhile, the following gene sets were highly enriched in BRCA2: cell cycle, DNA replication, homologous recombination, oocyte meiosis, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, base excision repair, progestin mediated oocyte maturation, basal transcription factor, biosynthesis of N polysaccharide, mismatch repair, sliceosome, purine metabolism as well as P53 and neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, etc.CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that the BRCA2 gene mutation is a good prognostic factor and can be used as a gene to predict the prognosis in the bladder cancer patients.\n","59":"\nThe liver plays a critical role in food and drug metabolism and detoxification and accordingly influences systemic body homeostasis in health and disease.

Here we show regional variations in the expression of Ywhaz, Gak, Gapdh, Hmbs and Act-\u03b2 endogenous genes across a liver lobe; Using homogeneous samples from the four liver lobes of 6 C57BL\/6 mice we tested the stability of 12 endogenous genes and show that Act-\u03b2 and Eif2-\u03b1 are the most stably expressed endogenous genes in all four lobes and demonstrate lobular differences in the expression of Abca1 cholesterol efflux gene. These results suggest that sampling from a specified homogeneous powdered liver lobe is paramount in enhancing data reliability and reproducibility. The stability of the 12 endogenous genes was further tested using homogeneous samples of left liver lobes from 20 ApoE-\/- mice on standard or high polyphenol diets. Act-\u03b2 and Ywhaz are suitable endogenous genes for gene expression normalisation in this mouse model.\n","60":"\nFunctional genomics in whitefly, Bemisia tabaci is gaining impetus due to its polyphagous nature, worldwide distribution and recently sequenced whole genome. These studies require an in-depth evaluation and validation of reference genes in different development stages and variable experimental setups. Normalization with reference genes is an essential step in the gene expression studies. Rather than selecting a reference gene empirically, the suitability of these genes must be validated for an individual organism, its specific stage or even for particular experimental conditions. The Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has evolved as an efficient and widely used technique for precise monitoring of gene expression. The prime focus of this study was to identify candidate reference genes in different developmental stages (adults, nymphs, eggs), sex (male and female), hosts (Gossypium hirsutum, G. arboreum), and under insecticidal and starvation stress. Expression stability of these genes in different experimental samples was evaluated by employing five different computational algorithms such as NormFinder, BestKeeper, Comparative delta-CT, geNorm and RefFinder. Our results identified a different set of reference genes under each experimental setup such as electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO), ubiquitin (UBIQ) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as best reference genes in adult whitefly. In addition, glutathione S-transferase (GST) in eggs, cyclophilin (CYCLOPH) in red eyed nymph, GAPDH in third instar, tubulin (Tub) in female, ubiquitin ribosomal protein S27 (UBIRPS2) in male, succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B (SDHB) under insecticidal stress, ETF-QO under starvation stress, UBIRPS2 under host influence were the top most stable genes.

Plant height, an important trait for maize breeding because of its close relatedness to lodging resistance and yield, has been reported to be determined by multiple qualitative and quantitative genes. However, few genes related to plant height have been characterized in maize. Herein, three different maize hybrids, with extremely distinct plant height, which were further classified into low (L), middle (M) and high (H) group, were selected for RNA sequencing at three key developmental stages, namely, jointing stage (I), big flare period (II) and tasseling stage (III). Intriguingly, transcriptome profiles for hybrids ranging from low to high group exhibited significantly similarity in both jointing stage and big flare period. However, remarkably larger differentially expressed genes could be detected between hybrid from low to either middle or high group in tasseling stage. These results were repeatedly observed in both phenotyping and gene ontology enrichment analysis, indicating that transition from big flare period to tasseling stage plays a critical role in determination of plant height. Furthermore, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was explored to find key hub genes involved in plant height regulation. Hundreds of candidate genes, encoding various transcription factors, and regulators involved in internode cell regulation and cell wall synthesis were identified in our network. More importantly, great majority of candidates were correlated to either metabolism or signaling pathway of several plant phytohormones. Particularly, numerous functionally characterized genes in gibberellic acid as well as brassinosteroids signaling transduction pathways were also discovered, suggesting their critical roles in plant height regulation. The present study could provide a modestly comprehensive insight into networks for regulation of plant height in maize.\n","62":"\nThe aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and to identify the key genes and pathways for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) using bioinformatics analysis.\nThe microarray data for GSE53868 included 12 POP and 12 non-POP anterior vaginal wall samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by GEO2R online tool. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID database, and a DEG-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING and visualized in Cytoscape. MCODE was used for module analysis of the PPI network.\nA total of 257 upregulated and 333 downregulated genes were identified. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the upregulated DEGs were strongly associated with immune response, complement activation, classical pathway, phagocytosis, and recognition; the downregulated genes were mainly associated with cellular response to zinc ion, negative regulation of growth, and apoptotic process. Based on the PPI network, IL6, MYC, CCL2, ICAM1, PTGS2, SERPINE1, ATF3, CDKN1A, and CDKN2A were screened as hub genes. The four most significant sub-modules of DEGs were extracted after network module analysis. These genes were mainly associated with the negative regulation of growth and inflammatory response. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were associated with Mineral absorption, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and chemokine signaling pathway.\nThese microarray data and bioinformatics analyses provide a useful method for the identification of key genes and pathways associated with POP. Moreover, some crucial DEGs, such as IL6, MYC, CCL2, ICAM1, PTGS2, SERPINE1, ATF3, CDKN1A, and CDKN2A, potentially play an important role in the development and progression of POP.\n","63":"\nGene expression in apple roots in response to various stress conditions is a less-explored research subject.

These genes were selected based on their low variance of gene expression in apple root tissues from a recent RNA-seq data set, and a few previously reported apple reference genes for other tissue types. Four methods, Delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, were used to evaluate their stability in apple root tissues of various genotypes and under different experimental conditions.

Hub genes were significantly down-regulated and the expression levels of the hub genes were different in different stages in hub gene verification. ROC curves indicated all hub genes had good diagnostic value for PTC (except for ABCA6 AUC\u2009=\u200989.5%, the 15 genes with AUC\u2009>\u200990%). Methylation analysis showed that hub gene verification ABCA6, ACACB, RMDN1 and TFPI were identified as differentially methylated genes, and the decreased expression level of these genes may relate to abnormal DNA methylation. Moreover, the expression levels of 8 top hub genes were correlated with tumor purity and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. These findings, including functional annotations and GSEA provide new insights into pathogenesis of PTC.\nThe hub genes and methylation of hub genes may as potential biomarkers provide new insights for diagnosis of PTC, and all these findings may be the direction to study the mechanisms underlying of PTC in the future.\n","65":"\nThe gain and loss of genes encoding transcription factors is of importance to understanding the evolution of gene regulatory complexity. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes encode a large superfamily of transcription factors. We systematically classify the bHLH genes from five mollusc, two annelid and one brachiopod genomes, tracing the pattern of bHLH gene evolution across these poorly studied Phyla. In total, 56-88 bHLH genes were identified in each genome, with most identifiable as members of previously described bilaterian families, or of new families we define. Of such families only one, Mesp, appears lost by all these species. Additional duplications have also played a role in the evolution of the bHLH gene repertoire, with many new lophotrochozoan-, mollusc-, bivalve-, or gastropod-specific genes defined. Using a combination of transcriptome mining, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization we compared the expression of several of these novel genes in tissues and embryos of the molluscs Crassostrea gigas and Patella vulgata, finding both conserved expression and evidence for neofunctionalization. We also map the positions of the genes across these genomes, identifying numerous gene linkages. Some reflect recent paralog divergence by tandem duplication, others are remnants of ancient tandem duplications dating to the lophotrochozoan or bilaterian common ancestors. These data are built into a model of the evolution of bHLH genes in molluscs, showing formidable evolutionary stasis at the family level but considerable within-family diversification by tandem gene duplication.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017.

Waste sludge is an important reservoir and discharge source for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, the quantities of seven tetracycline resistance genes (TC-ARGs), including tetA, tetC, tetG, tetM, tetO, tetW, and tetX, as well as those of class 1 integron (intI1) genes, during anaerobic sludge digestion process were comprehensively quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The effects of different doses of zero valent iron (Fe0) on the decrease and increase in the quantities of TC-ARGs and intI1 genes were investigated. The influence of plasmid conjugation on the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of the target TC-ARGs was preliminarily analyzed. The correlations between the quantities of TC-ARGs and intI1 gene have been discussed. The results showed that the quantities of TC-ARGs and intI1 genes decreased in different degrees during anaerobic sludge digestion, and the abundance of tetX gene was reduced by 2.4 orders of magnitude. When Fe0 was added, no significant reduction in the quantities of TC-ARGs and intI1 genes was observed. However, as the addition of Fe0 increased, the quantities of TC-ARGs and intI1 genes increased correspondingly, as compared to those in the control group. The results obtained from the quantities of TC-ARGs carried by plasmid DNA showed that plasmid conjugation probably promoted the HGT of TC-ARGs. A positive significant correlation was found between the quantities of tetG and intI1 genes, indicating that intI1 might play an important role in the evolution of tetG during sludge anaerobic digestion process.\n","67":"\nCopy number variants (CNVs) have been reported to be associated with diseases, traits, and evolution. However, it is hard to determine which gene should have priority as a target for further functional experiments if a CNV is rare or a singleton. In this study, we attempted to overcome this issue by using two approaches: by assessing the influences of gene dosage sensitivity and gene expression sensitivity. Dosage sensitive genes derived from two-round whole-genome duplication in previous studies. In addition, we proposed a cross-sectional omics approach that utilizes open data from GTEx to assess the effect of whole-genome CNVs on gene expression.\nAffymetrix Genome-Wide SNP Array 6.0 was used to detect CNVs by PennCNV and CNV Workshop. After quality controls for population stratification, family relationship and CNV detection, 287 patients with narcolepsy, 133 patients with essential hypersomnia, 380 patients with panic disorders, 164 patients with autism, 784 patients with Alzheimer disease and 1280 healthy individuals remained for the enrichment analysis.\nOverall, significant enrichment of dosage sensitive genes was found across patients with narcolepsy, panic disorders and autism. Particularly, significant enrichment of dosage-sensitive genes in duplications was observed across all diseases except for Alzheimer disease. For deletions, less or no enrichment of dosage-sensitive genes with deletions was seen in the patients when compared to the healthy individuals. Interestingly, significant enrichments of genes with expression sensitivity in brain were observed in patients with panic disorder and autism. While duplications presented a higher burden, deletions did not cause significant differences when compared to the healthy individuals. When we assess the effect of sensitivity to genome dosage and gene expression at the same time, the highest ratio of enrichment was observed in the group including dosage-sensitive genes and genes with expression sensitivity only in brain. In addition, shared CNV regions among the five neuropsychiatric diseases were also investigated.\nThis study contributed the evidence that dosage-sensitive genes are associated with CNVs among neuropsychiatric diseases. In addition, we utilized open data from GTEx to assess the effect of whole-genome CNVs on gene expression. We also investigated shared CNV region among neuropsychiatric diseases.\n","68":"\nBamboo is an important member of the family Poaceae and has many inflorescence and flowering features rarely observed in other plant groups. It retains an unusual form of perennialism by having a long vegetative phase that can extend up to 120\u00a0years, followed by flowering and death of the plants. In contrast to a large number of studies conducted on the annual, reference plants Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, molecular studies to characterize flowering pathways in perennial bamboo are lacking. Since photoperiod plays a crucial role in flower induction in most plants, important genes involved in this pathway have been studied in the field grown Bambusa tulda, which flowers after 40-50\u00a0years.\nWe identified several genes from B. tulda, including four related to the circadian clock [LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), ZEITLUPE (ZTL) and GIGANTEA (GI)], two circadian clock response integrators [CONSTANS A (COA), CONSTANS B (COB)] and four floral pathway integrators [FLOWERING LOCUS T1, 2, 3, 4 (FT1, 2, 3, 4)]. These genes were amplified from either gDNA and\/or cDNA using degenerate as well as gene specific primers based on homologous sequences obtained from related monocot species. The sequence identity and phylogenetic comparisons revealed their close relationships to homologs identified in the temperate bamboo Phyllostachys edulis. While the four BtFT homologs were highly similar to each other, BtCOA possessed a full-length B-box domain that was truncated in BtCOB. Analysis of the spatial expression of these genes in selected flowering and non-flowering tissue stages indicated their possible involvement in flowering. The diurnal expression patterns of the clock genes were comparable to their homologs in rice, except for BtZTL. Among multiple BtCO and BtFT homologs, the diurnal pattern of only BtCOA and BtFT3, 4 were synchronized in the flower inductive tissue, but not in the non-flowering tissues.\nThis study elucidates the photoperiodic regulation of bamboo homologs of important flowering genes. The finding also identifies copy number expansion and gene expression divergence of CO and FT in bamboo. Further studies are required to understand their functional role in bamboo flowering.\n","69":"\nHow regulatory networks incorporate additional components and how novel genes are functionally integrated into well-established developmental processes are two important and intertwined questions whose answers have major implications for understanding the evolution of development. We recently discovered a set of lineage-restricted genes with strong and specific expression patterns along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis of the embryo of the wasp Nasonia that may serve as a powerful system for addressing these questions. We sought to both understand the evolutionary history of these genes and to determine their functions in the Nasonia DV patterning system.\nWe have found that the novel DV genes are part of a large family of rapidly duplicating and diverging ankyrin domain-encoding genes that originated most likely by horizontal transfer from a prokaryote in a common ancestor of the wasp superfamily Chalcidoidea. We tested the function of those ankyrin-encoding genes expressed along the DV axis and found that they participate in early embryonic DV patterning. We also developed a new wasp model system (Melittobia) and found that some functional integration of ankyrin genes have been preserved for over 90 million years.\nOur results indicate that regulatory networks can incorporate novel genes that then become necessary for stable and repeatable outputs. Even a modest role in developmental networks may be enough to allow novel or duplicate genes to be maintained in the genome and become fully integrated network components.\n","70":"\nThe development and application of coalescent methods are undergoing rapid changes. One little explored area that bears on the application of gene-tree-based coalescent methods to species tree estimation is gene informativeness. Here, we investigate the accuracy of these coalescent methods when genes have minimal phylogenetic information, including the implementation of the multilocus bootstrap approach. Using simulated DNA sequences, we demonstrate that genes with minimal phylogenetic information can produce unreliable gene trees (i.e., high error in gene tree estimation), which may in turn reduce the accuracy of species tree estimation using gene-tree-based coalescent methods. We demonstrate that this problem can be alleviated by sampling more genes, as is commonly done in large-scale phylogenomic analyses. This applies even when these genes are minimally informative. If gene tree estimation is biased, however, gene-tree-based coalescent analyses will produce inconsistent results, which cannot be remedied by increasing the number of genes. In this case, it is not the gene-tree-based coalescent methods that are flawed, but rather the input data (i.e., estimated gene trees). Along these lines, the commonly used program PhyML has a tendency to infer one particular bifurcating topology even though it is best represented as a polytomy. We additionally corroborate these findings by analyzing the 183-locus mammal data set assembled by McCormack et al. (2012) using ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) and flanking DNA. Lastly, we demonstrate that when employing the multilocus bootstrap approach on this 183-locus data set, there is no strong conflict between species trees estimated from concatenation and gene-tree-based coalescent analyses, as has been previously suggested by Gatesy and Springer (2014). \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Staphylococcus capitis is a human pathogen that produces biofilm under stress, such as imposed by antimicrobial agents. In this study, a set of five commonly used staphylococcal reference genes (gyrB, sodA, recA, tuf and rpoB) were systematically evaluated in two clinical isolates of Staphylococcus capitis (S. capitis subspecies urealyticus and capitis, respectively) under erythromycin stress in mid-log and stationary phases. Two public software programs (geNorm and NormFinder) and two manual calculation methods, reference residue normalization (RRN) and relative quantitative (RQ), were applied. The potential reference genes selected by the four algorithms were further validated by comparing the expression of a well-studied biofilm gene (icaA) with phenotypic biofilm formation in S. capitis under four different experimental conditions. The four methods differed considerably in their ability to predict the most suitable reference gene or gene combination for comparing icaA expression under different conditions. Under the conditions used here, the RQ method provided better selection of reference genes than the other three algorithms; however, this finding needs to be confirmed with a larger number of isolates. This study reinforces the need to assess the stability of reference genes for analysis of target gene expression under different conditions and the use of more than one algorithm in such studies. Although this work was conducted using a specific human pathogen, it emphasizes the importance of selecting suitable reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression more generally. \n","72":"\nEight candidate housekeeping genes were examined as internal controls for normalizing expression analysis of durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) under drought and salinity stress conditions. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyse gene expression of multiple stress levels, plant ages (24 and 50 days old), and plant tissues (leaf and root). The algorithms BestKeeper, NormFinder, GeNorm, the delta Ct method and the RefFinder were applied to determine the stability of candidate genes. Under drought stress, the most stable reference genes were glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate, ubiquitin and \u03b2-tubulin2, whereas under salinity stress conditions, eukaryotic elongation factor 1-\u03b1, glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate and actin were identified as the most stable reference genes. Validation with stress-responsive genes NAC29 and NAC6 demonstrated that the expression level of target genes could be determined reliably with combinations of up to three of the reference genes. This is the first report on reference genes appropriate for quantification of target gene expression in T. durum under drought and salt stresses. Results of this investigation may be applicable to other Triticum species.\n","73":"\nAeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen of a wide range of freshwater and marine fish species. A. salmonicida is the causative agent of furunculosis, an immunosuppressive disease that typically progresses to septicemia. Several aspects of A. salmonicida pathogenesis has already been described, but fundamental genetic aspects of the psychrophilic lifestyle of this bacterium remain unknown. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a precise molecular technique used to detect very slight changes in gene expression. The appropriate choice of reference genes is essential for accurate normalization of qPCR gene expression data. Despite the available abundance of validated reference genes for mesophilic pathogens, a broad list of validated reference genes for A. salmonicida is not available. Here, we evaluated seven A. salmonicida reference genes under different culture conditions, including different growth phases, iron-limited and iron-supplemented conditions, and thermal stress. We determined that hfq maintained the most stable expression, followed by era, recA, rpoB, 16S, fabD, and gapA. The results of this study provided with an expanded list of reliable reference genes for A. salmonicida gene expression studies using qPCR.\nCrown Copyright \u00a9 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, reverse transcription and quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a powerful tool for gene expression evaluation. For a reliable analysis, however, it is necessary to select and validate housekeeping genes that allow proper transcription quantification. Stability of nine housekeeping genes (ACTB, BGLU, TUBB, CY, GAPDH, HPRTI, RPL5, SDHA and UBC) was evaluated in different tissues of red abalone (gill, head and gonad\/digestive gland). Four-fold serial dilutions of cDNA (from 25 ng\u03bcL(-1) to 0.39 ng\u03bcL(-1)) were used to prepare the standard curve, and it showed gene efficiencies between 0.95 and 0.99, with R(2)=0.99. geNorm and NormFinder analysis showed that RPL5 and CY were the most stable genes considering all tissues, whereas in gill HPRTI and BGLU were most stable. In gonad\/digestive gland, RPL5 and TUBB were the most stable genes with geNorm, while SDHA and HPRTI were the best using NormFinder. Similarly, in head the best genes were RPL5 and UBC with geNorm, and GAPDH and CY with NormFinder. The technical variability analysis with RPL5 and abalone gonad\/digestive gland tissue indicated a high repeatability with a variation coefficient within groups \u2264 0.56% and between groups \u2264 1.89%. These results will help us for further research in reproduction, thermoregulation and endocrinology in red abalone.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to explore the gene regulation patterns of E2 through estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ESR1) in osteosarcoma based on the combined analysis of ChIP-seq and gene microarray. All of the datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differential expression genes (DEGs) in E2 treated U2OS cells expressing ESR1 (U2OS-ER\u03b1) compared with those treated with vehicle were obtained based on R programming software. ESR1-specific binding sites (peaks) in E2 treated U2OS cells were identified through MACS. Overlaps between DEGs and ESR1 target genes which contained peaks in promoters were considered as reliable E2-mediated genes through ESR1 in osteosarcoma. Moreover, we conducted miRNA-Gene regulation analysis for those genes through miRWalk database to identify potential therapeutic targets for the genes. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs indicated their potential involvement in cancer, and cell activity-related processes. Fifteen overlaps were identified between DEGs and target genes of ESR1, of which 12 were found to be regulated by miRNA. Several known estrogen response genes and novel genes were obtained in this study and they might provide potential therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma.\n","76":"\nGenes are \"born,\" and eventually they \"die.\" These processes shape the phenotypic evolution of organisms and are hence of great biological interest. If genes die in plants, they generally do so quite rapidly. Here, we describe the fate of GOA-like genes that evolve in a dramatically different manner. GOA-like genes belong to the subfamily of Bsister genes of MIKC-type MADS-box genes. Typical MIKC-type genes encode conserved transcription factors controlling plant development. We show that ABS-like genes, a clade of Bsister genes, are indeed highly conserved in crucifers (Brassicaceae) maintaining the ancestral function of Bsister genes in ovule and seed development. In contrast, their closest paralogs, the GOA-like genes, have been undergoing convergent gene death in Brassicaceae. Intriguingly, erosion of GOA-like genes occurred after millions of years of coexistence with ABS-like genes. We thus describe Delayed Convergent Asymmetric Degeneration, a so far neglected but possibly frequent pattern of duplicate gene evolution that does not fit classical scenarios. Delayed Convergent Asymmetric Degeneration of GOA-like genes may have been initiated by a reduction in the expression of an ancestral GOA-like gene in the stem group of Brassicaceae and driven by dosage subfunctionalization. Our findings have profound implications for gene annotations in genomics, interpreting patterns of gene evolution and using genes in phylogeny reconstructions of species.\n","77":"\nPurpose: Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by dry mouth and eyes. To date, the exact molecular mechanisms of its etiology are still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify SS related key genes and functionally enriched pathways using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Materials and Methods: We downloaded the microarray data of 190 SS patients and 32 controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Gene network was constructed and genes were classified into different modules using WGCNA. In addition, for the hub genes in the most related module to SS, gene ontology analysis was applied. The expression profile and diagnostic capacity (ROC curve) of interested hub genes were verified using a dataset from the GEO. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was also performed. Results: A total of 1483 differentially expressed genes were filtered. Weighted gene coexpression network was constructed and genes were classified into 17 modules. Among them, the turquoise module was most closely associated with SS, which contained 278 genes. These genes were significantly enriched in 10 Gene Ontology terms, such as response to virus, immune response, defense response, response to cytokine stimulus, and the inflammatory response. A total of 19 hub genes (GBP1, PARP9, EPSTI1, LOC400759, STAT1, STAT2, IFIH1, EIF2AK2, TDRD7, IFI44, PARP12, FLJ20035, PARP14, ISGF3G, XAF1, RSAD2,LY6E, IFI44L, and DDX58) were identified. The expression levels of the five interested genes including EIF2AK2, GBP1, PARP12, PARP14, and TDRD7 were also confirmed. ROC curve analysis determined that the above five genes' expression can distinguish SS from controls (the area under the curve is all greater than 0.7). GSEA suggests that the SS samples with highly expressed EIF2AK2 or TDRD7 genes are correlated with inflammatory response, interferon \u03b1 response, and interferon \u03b3 response. Conclusion: The present study applied WGCNA to generate a holistic view of SS and provide a basis for the identification of potential pathways and hub genes that may be involved in the development of SS.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Yao, Song, Wang, Qin and Zhang.\n","78":"\nCarex rigescens is an ornamental turfgrass in northern China which has a relatively low maintenance cost and robust tolerance to many adverse environmental conditions, so it could be considered a new material for researching into plant stress resistance. However, suitable reference genes are vacant for obtaining reliable results in quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of C. rigescens in adversity research. In this study, we tested the expression stability of nine potential reference genes in leaves and roots under five different abiotic stress conditions, including cold, salt, heat, osmotic and cadmium (Cd). We then selected the best reference genes according to the analysis results calculated by three algorithmic programs (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) and used the RankAggreg package to merge the outputted data. The results showed that combinations of at least two reference genes should be used for reliable normalization except in heat-treated root samples, which require three reference genes. eIF-4\u03b1, GADPH, SAND and PEPKR1 and their combination were found to be the most stably expressed reference genes, while SAM, TUA-\u03b1 and UPL7 were the three least stable reference genes among most of experimental samples. In addition, five stress-induced genes (Cu-Zn SOD, P5CS, LEA, GST, and APX) were chosen to verify the stability of the selected reference genes in various tissues and under various stress conditions. The results of this study will provide an important fundamental basis both for gene expression verification for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses and for gene expression analysis for future gene function research in C. rigescens.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies have partitioned the genes into landmark genes and target genes and suggested that the landmark gene expression levels capture adequate information to reconstruct the target gene expression levels. This inspired us to propose that the methylation level of the promoters in landmark genes might be adequate to reconstruct the promoter methylation level of target genes, which would eventually reduce the cost of promoter methylation profiling. Here, we propose a deep learning model called Deep-Gene Promoter Methylation (D-GPM) to predict the whole-genome promoter methylation level based on the promoter methylation profile of the landmark genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). D-GPM-15%-7000 \u00d7 5, the optimal architecture of D-GPM, acquires the least overall mean absolute error (MAE) and the highest overall Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), with values of 0.0329 and 0.8186, respectively, when testing data. Additionally, the D-GPM outperforms the regression tree (RT), linear regression (LR), and the support vector machine (SVM) in 95.66%, 92.65%, and 85.49% of the target genes by virtue of its relatively lower MAE and in 98.25%, 91.00%, and 81.56% of the target genes based on its relatively higher PCC, respectively. More importantly, the D-GPM predominates in predicting 79.86% and 78.34% of the target genes according to the model distribution of the least MAE and the highest PCC, respectively.\n","80":"\nExpansin is a type of cell wall elongation and stress relaxation protein involved in various developmental processes and stress resistances in plant. In this study, we identified 36 potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) genes belonging to the expansin (StEXP) gene family from the genome reference. These genes included 24 \u03b1-expansins (StEXPAs), five \u03b2-expansins (StEXPBs), one expansin-like A (StEXLA) and six expansin-like B (StEXLBs). The RNA-Seq analysis conducted from a variety of tissue types showed 34 expansins differentially expressed among tissues, some of which only expressed in specific tissues. Most of the StEXPAs and StEXPB2 transcripts were more abundant in young tuber compared with other tissues, suggesting they likely play a role in tuber development. There were 31 genes, especially StEXLB6, showed differential expression under the treatments of ABA, IAA and GA3, as well as under the drought and heat stresses, indicating they were likely involved in potato stress resistance. In addition, the gene co-expression analysis indicated the StEXLBs likely contribute to a wider range of stress resistances compared with other genes. We found the StEXLA and six StEXLBs expressed differently under a range of abiotic stresses (salt, alkaline, heavy metals, drought, heat, and cold stresses), which likely participated in the associated signaling pathways. Comparing with the control group, potato growing under the drought or heat stresses exhibited up-regulation of the all six StEXLB genes in leaves, whereas, the StEXLB3, StEXLB4, StEXLB5 and StEXLB6 showed relatively higher expression levels in roots. This suggested these genes likely played a role in the drought and heat tolerance. Overall, this study has shown the potential role of the StEXP genes in potato growth and stress tolerance, and provided fundamental resources for the future studies in potato breeding.\n","81":"\nThe same nucleotide sequence can encode two protein products in different reading frames. Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains [Formula: see text] or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 by the Genetics Society of America.\n","82":"\nGene expression profiles can change dramatically between sexes and sex bias may contribute specific macroevolutionary dynamics for sex-biased genes. However, these dynamics are poorly understood at large evolutionary scales due to the paucity of studies that have assessed orthology and functional homology for sex-biased genes and the pleiotropic effects possibly constraining their evolutionary potential. Here, we explore the correlation of sex-biased expression with macroevolutionary processes that are associated with sex-biased genes, including duplications and accelerated evolutionary rates. Specifically, we examined these traits in a group of 44 genes that orchestrate sperm individualization during spermatogenesis, with both unbiased and sex-biased expression. We studied these genes in the broad evolutionary framework of the Insecta, with a particular focus on beetles (order Coleoptera). We studied data mined from 119 insect genomes, including 6 beetle models, and from 19 additional beetle transcriptomes. For the subset of physically and\/or genetically interacting proteins, we also analyzed how their network structure may condition the mode of gene evolution. The collection of genes was highly heterogeneous in duplication status, evolutionary rates, and rate stability, but there was statistical evidence for sex bias correlated with faster evolutionary rates, consistent with theoretical predictions. Faster rates were also correlated with clocklike (insect amino acids) and non-clocklike (beetle nucleotides) substitution patterns in these genes. Statistical associations (higher rates for central nodes) or lack thereof (centrality of duplicated genes) were in contrast to some current evolutionary hypotheses, highlighting the need for more research on these topics.\n","83":"\nGibberellin (GAs) plays the important role in the regulation of grape developmental and growth processes. The bioinformatics analysis confirmed the differential expression of GA2, GA3, and GA20 gibberellin oxidase genes (VvGA2oxs, VvGA3oxs, and VvGA20oxs) in the grape genome, and laid a theoretical basis for exploring its role in grape. Based on the Arabidopsis GA2oxs, GA3oxs, and GA20oxs genes already reported, the VvGA2oxs, VvGA3oxs, and VvGA20oxs genes in the grape genome were identified using the BLAST software in the grape genome database. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using software such as DNAMAN v.5.0, Clustalx, MapGene2Chrom, MEME, GSDS v.2.0, ExPASy, DNAsp v.5.0, and MEGA v.7.0. Chip expression profiles were generated using grape Affymetrix GeneChip 16K and Grape eFP Browser gene chip data in PLEXdb. The expression of VvGA2oxs, VvGA3oxs, and VvGA20oxs gene families in stress was examined by qRT-PCR (Quantitative real-time-PCR). There are 24 GAoxs genes identified with the grape genome that can be classified into seven subgroups based on a phylogenetic tree, gene structures, and conserved Motifs in our research. The gene family has higher codon preference, while selectivity is negative selection of codon bias and selective stress was analyzed. The expression profiles indicated that the most of VvGAox genes were highly expressed under different time lengths of ABA (Abscisic Acid) treatment, NaCl, PEG and 5 \u00b0C. Tissue expression analysis showed that the expression levels of VvGA2oxs and VvGA20oxs in different tissues at different developmental stages of grapes were relatively higher than that of VvGA3oxs. Last but not least, qRT-PCR (Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR) was used to determine the relative expression of the GAoxs gene family under the treatment of GA3 (gibberellin 3) and uniconazole, which can find that some VvGA2oxs was upregulated under GA3 treatment. Simultaneously, some VvGA3oxs and VvGA20oxs were upregulated under uniconazole treatment. In a nutshell, the GA2ox gene mainly functions to inactivate biologically active GAs, while GA20ox mainly degrades C20 gibberellins, and GA3ox is mainly composed of biologically active GAs. The comprehensive analysis of the three classes of VvGAoxs would provide a basis for understanding the evolution and function of the VvGAox gene family in a grape plant.\n","84":"\n\u03b2-amylase (BAM) genes play essential roles in plant abiotic stress responses. Although the genome of Chinese white pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) has recently been made available, knowledge regarding the BAM family in pear, including gene function, evolutionary history and patterns of gene expression remains limited. In this study, we identified 17 PbBAMs in the pear genome. Of these, 12 PbBAM members were mapped onto 9 chromosomes and 5 PbBAM genes were located on scaffold contigs. Based on gene structure, protein motif analysis, and the topology of the phylogenetic tree of the PbBAM family, we classified member genes into 4 groups. All PbBAM genes were found to contain typical glycosyl hydrolysis 14 domain motifs. Interfamilial comparisons revealed that the phylogenetic relationships of BAM genes in other Rosaceae species were similar those found in pear. We also found that whole-genome duplication (WGD)\/segmental duplication events played critical roles in the expansion of the BAM family. Next, we used transcriptomic data to study gene expression during the response of drought and low temperate responses, and found that genes in Group B were related to drought and cold stress. We identified four PbBAM genes associated with abiotic stress in Pear. Finally, by analyzing co-expression networks and co-regulatory genes, we found that PbBAM1a and PbBAM1b were associated with the pear abiotic stress response.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

For the quantitative analysis of the presence of ARGs, there is a need for sensitive and robust qPCR assays which can detect various genes from different types of DNA extracts. Fourteen ARGs were selected as target genes in this study including: blaTEM, blaOXA-1 and blaCTX-M coded for resistance to \u03b2-lactams; ermB for macrolides; tetA, tetG, tetM, tetQ, tetW and tetX for tetracyclines; sul I and sul II for sulfonamides; drfA1 and drfA12 d for trimethoprim; and integron gene intI 1 and intI 2. Chemically synthesized double-stranded gene fragments were modified using molecular biology methods and used as real-time PCR standards as well as to establish in-house qPCR assays. The ermB gene from a naturally occurring plasmid was used to compare the performance of qPCR assay with the chemically synthesized ermB. Additionally, environmental water, soil and faeces samples were used to validate the established qPCR assays. Importantly, the study proves the usefulness of rapidly synthesized oligonucleotides serving as qPCR standards for ARG analysis and provides comparable sensitivity and reliability to a traditional amplicon standard.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Also, the effector repertoire determines the host specificity of a pathogen. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) is the causal agent of banana wilt; however, knowledge about Foc effector genes is very limited. In this study, genome-wide effector gene identification was performed in Foc race 1 (Foc 1) and Foc race 4 (Foc 4) based on the context association between the effector genes and the transposable element mimp. A total of 20 candidate effector genes were identified, of which 3 were Foc 1-specific, 6 were Foc 4-specific, and 11 were present in both Foc 1 and Foc 4. Most genes (14 out of 20) showed a significant transcriptional burst in planta compared with in-culture conditions, from more than 10-fold to 1,617-fold, and at the highest 32,725-fold. In addition to Foc 1- and Foc 4-specific genes, the genes Foc 283, Foc 495, and Foc 594 also exhibited transcriptional race specificity. Sixteen of the twenty genes were predicted to have a signal peptide, nine genes might encode real effectors predicted by EffectorP 2.0, and eight genes had predicted motifs. To validate the pathogenicity of the candidate effector genes, we generated knockout mutant and complementants of the gene Foc 1324 and tested their virulence on banana plants. The results showed that Foc 1324 was a virulent factor and required for the pathogenicity of Foc 4.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

To protect it from harmful pest populations number of newer transgenic lines have been developed. For quick expression checks in successful agriculture qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) have become extremely popular. The selection of appropriate reference genes plays a critical role in the outcome of such experiments as the method quantifies expression of the target gene in comparison with the reference. Traditionally most commonly used reference genes are the \"house-keeping genes\", involved in basic cellular processes. However, expression levels of such genes often vary in response to experimental conditions, forcing the researchers to validate the reference genes for every experimental platform. This study presents a data science driven unbiased genome-wide search for the selection of reference genes by assessing variation of >\u200950,000 genes in a publicly available RNA-seq dataset of cotton species Gossypium hirsutum.\nFive genes (TMN5, TBL6, UTR5B, AT1g65240 and CYP76B6) identified by data-science driven analysis, along with two commonly used reference genes found in literature (PP2A1 and UBQ14) were taken through qPCR in a set of 33 experimental samples consisting of different tissues (leaves, square, stem and root), different stages of leaf (young and mature) and square development (small, medium and large) in both transgenic and non-transgenic plants. Expression stability of the genes was evaluated using four algorithms - geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and RefFinder.\nBased on the results we recommend the usage of TMN5 and TBL6 as the optimal candidate reference genes in qPCR experiments with normal and transgenic cotton plant tissues. AT1g65240 and PP2A1 can also be used if expression study includes squares. This study, for the first time successfully displays a data science driven genome-wide search method followed by experimental validation as a method of choice for selection of stable reference genes over the selection based on function alone.\n","88":"\nThe salinization and alkalization of soil are widespread environmental problems, and alkaline salt stress is more destructive than neutral salt stress. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of plant tolerance to saline-alkaline stress has become a major challenge. However, little attention has been paid to the mechanism of plant alkaline salt tolerance. In this study, gene expression profiling of flax was analyzed under alkaline-salt stress (AS2), neutral salt stress (NSS) and alkaline stress (AS) by digital gene expression. Three-week-old flax seedlings were placed in 25 mM Na2CO3 (pH11.6) (AS2), 50mM NaCl (NSS) and NaOH (pH11.6) (AS) for 18 h. There were 7736, 1566 and 454 differentially expressed genes in AS2, NSS and AS compared to CK, respectively. The GO category gene enrichment analysis revealed that photosynthesis was particularly affected in AS2, carbohydrate metabolism was particularly affected in NSS, and the response to biotic stimulus was particularly affected in AS. We also analyzed the expression pattern of five categories of genes including transcription factors, signaling transduction proteins, phytohormones, reactive oxygen species proteins and transporters under these three stresses. Some key regulatory gene families involved in abiotic stress, such as WRKY, MAPKKK, ABA, PrxR and ion channels, were differentially expressed. Compared with NSS and AS, AS2 triggered more differentially expressed genes and special pathways, indicating that the mechanism of AS2 was more complex than NSS and AS. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first transcriptome analysis of flax in response to saline-alkaline stress. These data indicate that common and diverse features of saline-alkaline stress provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of plant saline-alkaline tolerance and offer a number of candidate genes as potential markers of tolerance to saline-alkaline stress.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While these analyses enable the identification of candidate genes with key functions in schistosome biology, a diverse molecular tool set is needed that allows comprehensive functional characterization at the single gene level. This includes the availability of reliable reference genes to confirm changes in the transcription of genes of interest over different biological samples and experimental conditions. In particular, the investigation of one key aspect of schistosome biology, the pairing-dependent gene expression in females and males, requires knowledge on reference genes that are expressed independently of both pairing and of in vitro culture effects. Therefore, the present study focused on the identification of quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR reference genes suitable for the investigation of pairing-dependent gene expression in the S. mansoni male. The \"pipeline\" we present here is based on qRT-PCR analyses of high biological replication combined with three different statistical analysis tools, BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder. Our approach resulted in a statistically robust ranking of 15 selected reference genes with respect to their transcription stability between pairing-unexperienced and -experienced males. We further tested the top seven candidate genes for their transcription stability during invitro culture of adult S. mansoni. Of these, the two most suitable reference genes were used to investigate the influence of the pairing contact on the transcription of genes of interest, comprising a tyrosine decarboxylase gene Smtdc1, an ebony ortholog Smebony, and the follistatin ortholog Smfst in S. mansoni males. Performing pairing, separation and re-pairing experiments with adult S. mansoni in vitro, our results indicate for the first time that pairing can act as a molecular on\/off-switch of specific genes to strictly control their expression in schistosome males.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Australian Society for Parasitology.

In order to identify stable and reliable reference genes in Trichoderma afroharzianum under oxalic acid (OA) stress, six commonly used housekeeping genes, i.e., elongation factor 1, ubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-tubulin, actin, from the effective biocontrol isolate T. afroharzianum strain LTR-2 were tested for their expression during growth in liquid culture amended with OA. Four in silico programs (comparative \u0394Ct, NormFinder, geNorm and BestKeeper) were used to evaluate the expression stabilities of six candidate reference genes. The elongation factor 1 gene EF-1 was identified as the most stably expressed reference gene, and was used as the normalizer to quantify the expression level of the oxalate decarboxylase coding gene OXDC in T. afroharzianum strain LTR-2 under OA stress. The result showed that the expression of OXDC was significantly up-regulated as expected. This study provides an effective method to quantify expression changes of target genes in T. afroharzianum under OA stress.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To detect key genes and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MLL-R infant ALL, microarray expression data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between MLL-R and non-MLL-R infant ALL were identified. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were carried out. Then, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and identified the hub genes. Finally, drug-gene interactions were mined. A total of 139 cases of MLL-R infant ALL including 77 (55.4%) fusions with AF4, 38 (27.3%) with ENL, 14 (10.1%) with AF9, and 10 (7.2%) other gene fusions were characterized. A total of 236 up-regulated and 84 down-regulated DEGs were identified. The up-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in homophilic cell adhesion, negative regulation of apoptotic process and cellular response to drug GO terms, while down-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix organization, protein kinase C signaling and neuron projection extension GO terms. The up-regulated DEGs were enriched in seven KEGG pathways, mainly involving transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways, and down-regulated DEGs were involved in three main KEGG pathways including Alzheimer's disease, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and hematopoietic cell lineage. The PPI network included 297 nodes and 410 edges, with MYC, ALB, CD44, PTPRC and TNF identified as hub genes. Twenty-three drug-gene interactions including four up-regulated hub genes and 24 drugs were constructed by Drug Gene Interaction database (DGIdb). In conclusion, MYC, ALB, CD44, PTPRC and TNF may be potential bio-markers for the diagnosis and therapy of MLL-R infant ALL.\n","92":"\nThe aim of this study was to explore potential crucial genes associated with the steroid-induced necrosis of femoral head (SINFH) and to provide valid biological information for further investigation of SINFH. Gene expression profile of GSE26316, generated from 3 SINFH rat samples and 3 normal rat samples were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using LIMMA package. After functional enrichment analyses of DEGs, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sub-PPI network analyses were conducted based on the STRING database and cytoscape. In total, 59 up-regulated DEGs and 156 downregulated DEGs were identified. The up-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in functions about immunity (e.g. Fcer1A and Il7R), and the downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in muscle system process (e.g. Tnni2, Mylpf and Myl1). The PPI network of DEGs consisted of 123 nodes and 300 interactions. Tnni2, Mylpf, and Myl1 were the top 3 outstanding genes based on both subgraph centrality and degree centrality evaluation. These three genes interacted with each other in the network. Furthermore, the significant network module was composed of 22 downregulated genes (e.g. Tnni2, Mylpf and Myl1). These genes were mainly enriched in functions like muscle system process. The DEGs related to the regulation of immune system process (e.g. Fcer1A and Il7R), and DEGs correlated with muscle system process (e.g. Tnni2, Mylpf and Myl1) may be closely associated with the progress of SINFH, which is still needed to be confirmed by experiments.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, an appropriate reference gene as a standard is needed to obtain accurate gene expression data. To date, no internal reference genes have been reported for research on cranberries. Expanding the selection of internal reference genes for cranberry will enable reliable gene expression analysis, and, at the same time, can also lay a solid foundation for revealing the biological characteristics of cranberry. Here, we selected ten candidate reference gene families and used three statistical software tools-geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper-to evaluate their expression stability under the influence of different experimental factors. The results showed that protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit (PP2A) or RNA helicase-like 8 (RH 8) was the best choice for an internal reference gene when analyzing different cranberry cultivars. In two sample sets comprising different cranberry organs and three abiotic stress treatments, sand family protein (SAND) was the best choice as a reference gene. In this study, we screened genes that are stably expressed under the influence of various experimental factors by qRT-PCR. Our results will guide future studies involving gene expression analysis of cranberry.\n","94":"\nQuantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used to analyze the relative gene expression level, however, the accuracy of qRT-PCR is greatly affected by the stability of reference genes, which is tissue- and environment- dependent. Therefore, choosing the most stable reference gene in a specific tissue and environment is critical to interpret gene expression patterns. Aluminum (Al), cadmium (Cd), and heat stresses are three important abiotic factors limiting soybean (Glycine max) production in southern China. To identify the suitable reference genes for normalizing the expression levels of target genes by qRT-PCR in soybean response to Al, Cd and heat stresses, we studied the expression stability of ten commonly used housekeeping genes in soybean roots and leaves under these three abiotic stresses, using five approaches, BestKeeper, Delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder. We found TUA4 is the most stable reference gene in soybean root tips under Al stress. Under Cd stress, Fbox and UKN2 are the most stable reference genes in roots and leaves, respectively, while 60S is the most suitable reference gene when analyzing both roots and leaves together. For heat stress, TUA4 and UKN2 are the most stable housekeeping genes in roots and leaves, respectively, and UKN2 is the best reference gene for analysis of roots and leaves together. To validate the reference genes, we quantified the relative expression levels of six target genes that were involved in soybean response to Al, Cd or heat stresses, respectively. The expression patterns of these target genes differed between using the most and least stable reference genes, suggesting the selection of a suitable reference gene is critical for gene expression studies.\n","95":"\nInduced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) reprogramming allows to turn a differentiated somatic cell into a pluripotent cell. This process is accompanied by many changes in fundamental cell properties, such as energy production, cell-to-cell interactions, cytoskeletal organization, and others. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) can be used as a quantitative method of gene expression analysis to investigate iPS reprogramming but it requires a validation of reference genes for the accurate assessment of target genes' expression. Currently, studies evaluating the performance of reference genes during iPS reprogramming are lacking. In this study we analysed the stability of 12 housekeeping genes during 20 days of iPS reprogramming of murine cells based on statistical analyses of RT-qPCR data using five different statistical algorithms. This study reports strong variations in housekeeping gene stability during the reprogramming process. Most stable genes were Atp5f1, Pgk1 and Gapdh, while the least stable genes were Rps18, Hprt, Tbp and Actb. The results were validated by a proof-of-point qPCR experiment with pluripotent markers Nanog, Rex1 and Oct4 normalized to the best and the worst reference gene identified by the analyses. Overall, this study and its implications are particularly relevant to investigations on the cell-state and pluripotency in iPS reprogramming.\n","96":"\nThe aim of the present study was to analyze lung adenocarcinoma-associated microarray data and identify potentially crucial genes. The gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and 6 datasets, of which 2 were discarded and 4 were retained, were preprocessed using packages in the R computing language. Subsequently, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and meta-analysis was used to screen the common pathways and differentially expressed genes at the transcriptional level. The genes detected from GSEA through The Cancer Genome Atlas databases were subsequently examined, and the crucial genes by survival data were identified. Pathways of the crucial genes were obtained using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway of the online website Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool, and the pathways of crucial genes that were upregulated or downregulated were matched using the Venn method to identify the common crucial pathways. Furthermore, on the basis of the common crucial pathways, key genes that are closely associated with the development and progression of lung adenocarcinoma were identified with the KEGG pathway of DAVID. Additional information was obtained through Gene Ontology annotation. A total of two key pathways, including cell cycle and DNA replication, as well as 12 key genes [DNA polymerase \u03b4 subunit 2, DNA replication licensing factor MCM4, MCM6, mitotic checkpoint serine\/threonine-protein kinase BUB1, BUB1\u03b2, mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2A, dual specificity protein kinase TTK, M-phase inducer phosphatase 1, cell division control protein 45 homolog, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C, pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 protein and polo-like kinase 1] were identified. These key pathways and genes may be studied in future studies involving gene transfection\/knockdown, which may provide insights into the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma.

Of particular interest is the study of complex interactions between molecular genetic factors, electrophysiological properties of the nervous system, and the behavioral characteristics of people. The neurobiological understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders requires not only the identification of genes that play a role in the molecular mechanisms of the occurrence and course of diseases, but also the understanding of complex interactions that occur between these genes. A systematic study of such interactions obviously contributes to the development of new methods of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disorders, as the orientation to allele variants of individual loci is not reliable enough, because the literature describes a number of genes, the same alleles of which can be associated with different, sometimes extremely different variants of phenotypic traits, depending on the genetic background, of their carriers, habitat, and other factors.\nIn our study, we have reconstructed a series of gene networks (in the form of protein-protein interactions networks, as well as networks of transcription regulation) to build a model of the influence of complex interactions of environmental factors and genetic risk factors for intellectual disability, depression, and other disorders in human behavior.\nA list of candidate genes whose expression is presumably associated with environmental factors and has potentially contentious manifestation for behavioral and neurological traits is identified for further experimental verification.\n","98":"\nQuantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has been used frequently to study gene expression related to fish immunology. In such studies, a stable reference gene should be selected to correct the expression of the target gene. In this study, seven candidate reference genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBCE), 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1A), tubulin alpha chain-like (TUBA) and beta actin (ACTB)), were selected to analyze their stability and normalization in seven tissues (liver, spleen, kidney, brain, heart, muscle and intestine) of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) challenged with Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus iniae, respectively. The results showed that all the candidate reference genes exhibited tissue-dependent transcriptional variations. With PBS injection as a control, UBCE was the most stable and suitable single reference gene in the intestine, liver, brain, kidney, and spleen after S. iniae infection, and in the liver, kidney, and spleen after S. agalactiae infection. EF1A was the most suitable in heart and muscle after S. iniae or S. agalactiae infection. GADPH was the most suitable gene in intestine and brain after S. agalactiae infection. In normal conditions, UBCE and 18S rRNA were the most stably expressed genes across the various tissues. These results showed that for RT-qPCR analysis of tilapia, selecting two or more reference genes may be more suitable for cross-tissue analysis of gene expression. \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an elicitor that has been demonstrated to have a vital influence on ginsenoside biosynthesis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) has been widely used in quantification of gene expressions. Here, we report the selection and validation of reference genes desirable for normalization of gene expressions quantified by qRT-PCR in ginseng hairy roots treated with MeJA. Twelve reference genes were selected as candidate genes, and their expressions were quantified by qRT-PCR, and analyzed by geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. CYP and EF-1\u03b1 were shown to be the most stable reference genes in geNorm, CYP was the most stable reference gene in NormFinder, and 18S was the most stable reference gene in BestKeeper. On this basis, we further quantified the relative expression levels of four genes encoding key enzymes that are involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis using CYP and 18S as the reference genes, respectively. Moreover, correlation analysis was performed between the quantified expressions of four genes and the ginsenoside content in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots. The results of relative expressions of the four genes quantified using CYP as the reference gene and their significant correlations with the ginsenoside content were better than those using 18S as the reference gene. The CYP gene, hence, was concluded as the most desirable reference gene for quantification of the expressions of genes in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots. This finding, therefore, provides information useful for gene research in ginseng, particularly in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots, which includes identification and characterization of genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis.\n","100":"\nIn order to better understand the biological systems that are affected in response to cosmic ray (CR), we conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis using the module detection method. By using the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) value, we evaluated complex gene-gene functional interactions between 680 CR-responsive probes from integrated microarray data sets, which included large-scale transcriptional profiling of 1000 microarray samples. These probes were divided into 6 distinct modules that contained 20 enriched gene ontology (GO) functions, such as oxidoreductase activity, hydrolase activity, and response to stimulus and stress. In particular, modules 1 and 2 commonly showed enriched annotation categories such as oxidoreductase activity, including enriched cis-regulatory elements known as ROS-specific regulators. These results suggest that the ROS-mediated irradiation response pathway is affected by CR in modules 1 and 2. We found 243 ionizing radiation (IR)-responsive probes that exhibited similarities in expression patterns in various irradiation microarray data sets. The expression patterns of 6 randomly selected IR-responsive genes were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction following treatment with CR, gamma rays (GR), and ion beam (IB); similar patterns were observed among these genes under these 3 treatments. Moreover, we constructed subnetworks of IR-responsive genes and evaluated the expression levels of their neighboring genes following GR treatment; similar patterns were observed among them. These results of network-based analyses might provide a clue to understanding the complex biological system related to the CR response in plants. \nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

De novo gene synthesis is quickly replacing the classical cloning and mutagenesis procedures and allows generating nucleic acids for which no template is available. In addition, when coupled with efficient gene design algorithms that optimize codon usage, it leads to high levels of recombinant protein expression.\nHere, we describe the development of an optimized gene synthesis platform that was applied to the large scale production of small genes encoding venom peptides. This improved gene synthesis method uses a PCR-based protocol to assemble synthetic DNA from pools of overlapping oligonucleotides and was developed to synthesise multiples genes simultaneously. This technology incorporates an accurate, automated and cost effective ligation independent cloning step to directly integrate the synthetic genes into an effective Escherichia coli expression vector. The robustness of this technology to generate large libraries of dozens to thousands of synthetic nucleic acids was demonstrated through the parallel and simultaneous synthesis of 96 genes encoding animal toxins.\nAn automated platform was developed for the large-scale synthesis of small genes encoding eukaryotic toxins.

In this study, a co-expression network-based approach was used for analyzing the genes from microarray data. Our approach consists of a simple but robust rank-based network construction. The publicly available gene expression data of Solanum tuberosum under cold and heat stresses were considered to create and analyze a gene co-expression network. The analysis provide highly co-expressed module of bHLH coding genes based on correlation values. Our approach was to analyze the variation of genes expression, according to the time period of stress through co-expression network approach.

Terminal erythroid differentiation results in dramatic upregulation of alpha-globin genes making their expression comparable to the rRNA transcriptional output. Little is known about the influence of the erythroid-specific alpha-globin gene transcription outburst on adjacent, widely expressed genes and large-scale chromatin organization. Here, we have analyzed the total transcription output, the overall chromatin contact profile, and CTCF binding within the 2.7\u00a0Mb segment of chicken chromosome 14 harboring the alpha-globin gene cluster in cultured lymphoid cells and cultured erythroid cells before and after induction of terminal erythroid differentiation.\nWe found that, similarly to mammalian genome, the chicken genomes is organized in TADs and compartments. Full activation of the alpha-globin gene transcription in differentiated erythroid cells is correlated with upregulation of several adjacent housekeeping genes and the emergence of abundant intergenic transcription. An extended chromosome region encompassing the alpha-globin cluster becomes significantly decompacted in differentiated erythroid cells, and depleted in CTCF binding and CTCF-anchored chromatin loops, while the sub-TAD harboring alpha-globin gene cluster and the upstream major regulatory element (MRE) becomes highly enriched with chromatin interactions as compared to lymphoid and proliferating erythroid cells. The alpha-globin gene domain and the neighboring loci reside within the A-like chromatin compartment in both lymphoid and erythroid cells and become further segregated from the upstream gene desert upon terminal erythroid differentiation.\nOur findings demonstrate that the effects of tissue-specific transcription activation are not restricted to the host genomic locus but affect the overall chromatin structure and transcriptional output of the encompassing topologically associating domain.\n","104":"\nIdentification of driver genes contributes to the understanding of cancer etiology and is imperative for the development of individualized therapies.

Amplification-dependent overexpression of 64 known driver oncogenes were found in 587 tumors (40%); genes frequently observed were MYC (25%) and MET (18%) in colorectal cancer; SKP2 (21%) in lung squamous cell carcinoma; HIST1H3B (19%) and MYCN (13%) in liver cancer; KIT (57%) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors; and FOXL2 (12%) in squamous cell carcinoma across tissues. Genomic aberrations in 138 known cancer driver genes and 491 established fusion genes were found in 1,127 tumors (78%). Further analyses of 820 cancer-related genes revealed 16 as potential driver genes, with amplification-dependent overexpression restricted to the remaining 22% of samples (327 tumors) initially undetermined genetic drivers. Among them, AXL, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, was recurrently overexpressed and amplified in sarcomas.

The following genes controlling heading were examined for their responses to six different environmental conditions involving different day lengths using five early near-isogenic lines (NILs) of T65-R and three late NILs of T65wx: two earliness genes, Ef1 and Efx controlling basic vegetative phase (BVG), and m-Ef1, the enhancer to the former gene; and two lateness genes, Se1-pat(t) and se-pat controlling photo-sensitivity and BVG, respectively. T65-R and T65-T were different accessions of Taichung 65. T65wx is a NIL of T65-T carrying wx.\nThe five early NILs of T65-R were in the order of ER50 (Ef1, Efx, m-Ef1)\u2009<\u2009ER40 (Ef1, m-Ef1)\u2009\u2264\u2009ER20 (Ef1, Efx)\u2009<\u2009ER1 (Ef1)\u2009\u2264\u2009ER21 (Efx)\u2009<\u2009T65-R regarding days to heading (DTH) under two spring-sowing and one summer-sowing paddy field (PF) conditions.

T65-R (Ac-ef1) was 2.8 or 5.1\u2009days earlier in DTH than T65-T (ac-ef1) under the two spring-sowing PF conditions. However, T65-R was 19 and 10\u2009days earlier than T65-T under the two short-day conditions.\nEarliness gene(s) and their combinations reduced DTH regardless of photoperiod lengths. Se1-pat(t) increased DTH under long-day conditions but decreased it under short-day conditions, while se-pat elongated DTH under both short-day and long-day conditions indicating that se-pat is responsible for BVG. The se-pat increased DTH by adding its effect over that of Se1-pat(t) under long-day conditions. However, this increasing effect of DTH by se-pat was almost completely masked when it coexisted with Se1-pat(t) under the short-day conditions. Notably, the response of Ac-ef1 to day length was found to delay heading under the short-day conditions.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.\n","106":"\nInternal reference genes that are stably expressed are essential for normalization in comparative expression analyses. However, gene expression varies significantly among species, organisms, tissues, developmental stages, stresses, and treatments. Therefore, identification of stably expressed reference genes in developmental endosperm of bread wheat is important for expression analysis of endosperm genes. As the first study to systematically screen for reference genes across different developmental stages of wheat endosperm, nine genes were selected from among 76 relatively stable genes based on high-throughput RNA sequencing data. The expression stability of these candidate genes and five traditional reference genes was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR combined with three independent algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results showed that ATG8d was the most stable gene during wheat endosperm development, followed by Ta54227, while the housekeeping gene GAPDH, commonly used as an internal reference, was the least stable. ATG8d and Ta54227 together formed the optimal combination of reference genes. Comparative expression analysis of glutenin genes indicated that credible quantification could be achieved by normalization against ATG8d in developmental endosperm. The stably expressed gene characterized here can act as a proper internal reference for expression analysis of wheat endosperm genes, especially nutrient- and nutrient synthesis-related genes.\n","107":"\nReporter genes facilitate the characterization of promoter activities, transcript stabilities, translational efficiencies, or intracellular localization. Various reporter genes for Escherichia coli have been established, however, most of them have drawbacks like transcript instability or the inability to be used in genetic selections. Therefore, the glpD gene encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was introduced as a novel reporter gene for E. coli. The enzymatic assay was optimized, and it was verified that growth on glycerol strictly depends on the presence of GlpD. The 5'-UTRs of three E. coli genes were chosen and cloned upstream of the new reporter gene glpD as well as the established reporter genes lacZ and gusA. Protein and transcript levels were quantified and translational efficiencies were calculated. The lacZ transcript was very unstable and its level highly depended on its translation, compromising its use as a reporter. The results obtained with gusA and glpD were similar, however, only glpD can be used for genetic selections. Therefore, glpD was found to be a superior novel reporter gene compared to the established reporter genes lacZ and gusA.\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The sites of rRNA gene contact often fall on extended (up to 50 kb) regions containing a chromatin mark, H3K27ac histone, typical for superenhancers, as well as on pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions of chromosomes. We found that the DUX4 genes located in the subtelomeric region of human chromosome 4 are surrounded by regions that are often in contact with the rRNA genes. The 25 kb region of this chromosome, presented in version hg19 of the sequenced human genome, contains several copies of the DUX4 gene. The sites of rRNA gene contacts located around this region contain methylation sites as well as CTCF binding sites. It is assumed that the rRNA gene contacts are important in silencing these DUX4 gene copies.\n","109":"\nReverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become an invaluable technique for analyzing gene expression in many insects. However, this approach requires the use of stable reference genes to normalize the data. Chlorops oryzae causes significant economic damage to rice crops throughout Asia. The lack of suitable reference genes has hindered research on the molecular mechanisms underlying many physiological processes of this species. In this study, we used quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of eight C. oryzae housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), \u03b2-actin (\u03b2ACT), beta-tubulin (\u03b2TUB), Delta Elongation factor-1 (EF1\u03b4), ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11), RPS15, C-terminal-Binding Protein (CtBP), and ribosomal protein 49 (RP49) in different developmental stages and tissues in both larvae and adults. We analyzed the data with four different software packages: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder and compared the results obtained with each method. The results indicate that PRS15 and RP49 can be used as stable reference genes for quantifying gene expression in different developmental stages and larval tissues. GAPDH and \u03b2ACT, which have been considered stable reference genes by previous studies, were the least stable of the candidate genes with respect to larval tissues. GAPDH was, however, the most stable reference gene for adult tissues. We verified the candidate reference genes identified and found that the expression levels of Cadherins (Cads) changed when different reference genes were used to normalize gene expression. This study provides a valuable foundation for future research on gene function, and investigating the molecular basis of physiological processes, in C. oryzae.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.

This study was aimed to investigate the role of Stk11-knockout in chondrocyte by bioinformatics analysis. The gene expression profiles for Stk11-knockout and wild-type mice were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 1104 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by Affymetrix Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) software, including 560 up-regulated and 544 down-regulated genes. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were built by mapping DEGs into STRING, in which hub genes such as Fos, Pdgfrb, Pdgfra, Flt1\/Vegfr1, Smad3, Mapk14, Twist and Aurkb were further identified. For the up-regulated genes, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway were two main pathways in the KEGG analysis, and ossification and extracellular matrix organization were involved in the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. On the other hand, the down-regulated genes were mainly involved in systemic lupus erythematosus and alcoholism pathways, and B cell receptor signaling pathway and immune system process biological processes. MiRNA-9, miRNA-134, miRNA-492, miRNA-224 and miRNA-142-5p were identified as key regulators in the miRNAs-DEG regulatory network. Additionally, OSF2\/RUNX2, and NFAT regulated DEGs collectively in the transcription factor regulatory network. The results of RT-PCR verified that the expression of hub genes, transcription factors and miRNAs in our experiment were basically consistent with the microarray hybridization. In this study, we provide an insight into the role of Stk11 in chondrocyte and identify novel genes related to Stk11.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018.

Molecular based studies on the response mechanisms of forest trees to abiotic stresses started in 2006 when Populus trichocarpa genome sequence was completed as a model tree species. In recent years, bioinformatic analyzes have been carried out to determine functional gene regions of tree species. In this study, sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp90 and Hsp100 gene family members were identified in poplar genome. Some bioinformatics analyses were conducted, such as: identification of DNA\/protein sequences, chromosomal localization, gene structure, calculation of genomic duplications, determination of phylogenetic groups, examination of protected motif regions, identification of gene ontology categories, modeling of protein 3D structure, determination of miRNA targeting genes, examination of sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp90 and Hsp100 gene family members in transcriptome data during salinity stress. As a result of bioinformatic analyzes made on P. trichocarpa genome; 60, 145, 49, 34, 12 and 90 genes belonging to members of sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp100 protein families were firstly defined within the scope of this study. A total of 390 genes belonging to all Hsps gene families were characterized using different bioinformatics tools. In addition, salinity stress was applied to Populus tremula L. (Samsun) naturally grown in Turkey, Hybrid poplar species I-214 (Populus euramericana Dode. Guinier) and Black Poplar species (Populus nigra L.), Geyve and N.03.368.A clones. The expression levels of the selected Hsps genes were determined by the qRT-PCR method. After salt stress application in various poplar clones, expression levels of genes including PtsHsp-11, PtsHsp-21, PtsHsp-36, PtHsp40-113, PtHsp40-117, PtHsp60-31, PtHsp60-33, PtHsp60-38, PtHsp60-49, PtHsp70-09, PtHsp70-12, 33, PtHsp90-09, PtHsp90-12, PtHsp100-21, and PtHsp100-75 were increased. The role of the Hsps genes during salt stress has been revealed. Together with detailed bioinformatics analyses, gene expression analysis greatly contributes to understand functions of these gene family members. This research serves as a blueprint for future studies and offers a significant clue for the further study of the functions of this important gene family. Moreover, determined genes in this study can also be used for cloning studies in agricultural practices.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Five reference-gene validation programs were used to establish the order of the most stable genes for the systemically-infecting viruses as ribosomal protein L25 > \u03b2-Tubulin > Actin, and the least stable genes Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UCE) < PP2A < GAPDH. For local infection by TMV, the most stable genes were EF1\u03b1 > Cysteine protease > Actin, and the least stable genes were GAPDH < PP2A < UCE. Using two of the most stable and the two least stable validated reference genes, three defense responsive genes were examined to compare their relative changes in gene expression caused by each virus.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Melanoma incidence and mortality rates have been rising around the world. As the current knowledge about pathogenesis, clinical and genetic features of cutaneous melanoma is not very clear, we aim to use bioinformatics to identify the potential key genes involved in the expression and mutation status of BRAF.\nFirstly, we used UCSC public hub datasets of melanoma (Lin et al., Cancer Res 68(3):664, 2008) to perform weighted genes co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed genes analysis (DEGs), respectively. Secondly, overlapping genes between significant gene modules and DEGs were screened and validated at transcriptional levels and overall survival in TCGA and GTEx datasets. Lastly, the functional enrichment analysis was accomplished to find biological functions on the web-server database.\nWe performed weighted correlation network and differential expression analyses, using gene expression data in melanoma samples. We identified 20 genes whose expression was correlated with the mutation status of BRAF. For further validation, three of these genes (CYR61, DUSP1, and RNASE4) were found to have similar expression patterns in skin tumors from TCGA compared with normal skin samples from GTEx. We also found that weak expression of these three genes was associated with worse overall survival in the TCGA data. These three genes were involved in the nucleic acid metabolic process.\nIn this study, CYR61, DUSP1, and RNASE4 were identified as potential genes of interest for future molecular studies in melanoma, which would improve our understanding of its causes and underlying molecular events. These candidate genes may provide a promising avenue of future research for therapeutic targets in melanoma.\n","114":"\nCaragana korshinskii Kom. is a legume shrub that is widely distributed across desert habitats with gravely, sandy, and saline soils in Asia and Africa. C. korshinskii has highly developed roots and a strong tolerance to abiotic stress. At present, there are few genetic studies of C. korshinskii because of the limited availability of genomic resources. To understand the comprehensive mechanisms that are associated with drought tolerance, we used RNA-seq to survey the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in comparisons of drought-treated and control plants. After analysing the sequencing results, we found 440 differentially expressed genes existing in drought-treated and control plants. Among the DEGs, 39 unigenes showed up-regulated expression after drought treatment, while 401 unigenes were down-regulated. We used the KEGG database to annotate these drought-induced genes; 126 unigenes were identified by KEGG pathway annotation, and approximately 28% of the unigenes with known function fell into categories related to fatty acid metabolism, starch, sucrose metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism, suggesting that these pathways or processes may be involved in the drought response. Finally, we confirmed that one gene has a potential function in drought tolerance. Our study is the first to provide transcriptomic resources for Caragana korshinskii and to determine its digital gene expression profile under conditions of drought stress using the assembled transcriptomic data for reference. These data provide a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies of desert plants under abiotic stress conditions.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The low-resolution label \"strabismus\" covers a range of heterogeneous defects, which makes it challenging to unravel this condition. Consequently a coherent understanding of the causes is lacking. Here, we attempt to gain a better understanding of the underlying genetics by combining gene curation, diverse bioinformatic analyses (including gene ontology, pathway mapping, expression and network-based methods) and literature review. Through a phenotype-based curation process, we identify high-confidence and permissive sets of 54 and 233 genes potentially involved in strabismus. These genes can be grouped into 10 modules that together span a heterogeneous set of biological and molecular functions, and can be linked to clinical sub-phenotypes. Multiple lines of evidence associate retina and cerebellum biology with the strabismus genes. We further highlight a potential role of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Independently, sets of 11 genes and 15 loci tied to strabismus with definitive genetic basis have been compiled from the literature. We identify strabismus candidate genes for 5 of the 15 reported loci (CHD7; SLC9A6; COL18A1, COL6A2; FRY, BRCA2, SPG20; PARK2). Finally, we synthesize a Strabismus Candidate Gene Collection, which together with our curated gene sets will serve as a resource for future research. The results of this informatics study support the heterogeneity and complexity of strabismus and point to specific biological pathways and brain regions for future focus.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

We have identified nine co-localized CYP2 genes (\u223c55kb) in a new cluster in the genome of the highly resilient ecotoxicological fish model Kryptolebias marmoratus. Molecular characterization, temporal and tissue-specific expression pattern, and response to xenobiotics of these genes were examined. The CYP2 gene clusters were characterized and designated CYP2N22-23, CYP2AD12, and CYP2P16-20. Gene synteny analysis confirmed that the cluster in K. marmoratus is similar to that found in other teleost fishes, including zebrafish. A gene duplication event with diverged catalytic function was observed in CYP2AD12. Moreover, a high level of divergence in expression was observed among the co-localized genes. Phylogeny of the cluster suggested an orthologous relationship with similar genes in zebrafish and Japanese medaka. Gene expression analysis showed that CYP2P19 and CYP2N20 were consecutively expressed throughout embryonic development, whereas CYP2P18 was expressed in all adult tissues, suggesting that members of each CYP2 gene family have different physiological roles even though they are located in the same cluster. Among endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), benzo[\u03b1]pyrene (B[\u03b1]P) induced expression of CYP2N23, bisphenol A (BPA) induced CYP2P18 and CYP2P19, and 4-octylphenol (OP) induced CYP2AD12, but there was no significant response to 4-nonylphenol (NP), implying differential catalytic roles of the enzyme. In this paper, we identify and characterize a CYP2 gene cluster in the mangrove killifish K. marmoratus with differing catalytic roles toward EDCs. Our findings provide insights on the roles of nine co-localized CYP2 genes and their catalytic functions for better understanding of chemical-biological interactions in fish.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

MADS-box genes are crucial transcription factors involving in plant development and several biological processes. However, there is no systematic analysis of MADS-box family genes in pineapple (Ananas comosus).\nForty-eight MADS-box genes were identified in the pineapple genome. Based on the phylogenetic studies, pineapple MADS-box genes can be divided into type I and type II MADS-box genes. Thirty-four pineapple genes were classified as type II MADS-box genes including 32 MIKC-type and 2 M\u03b4-type, while 14 type I MADS-box genes were further divided into M\u03b1, M\u03b2 and M\u03b3 subgroups. A majority of pineapple MADS-box genes were randomly distributed across 19 chromosomes. RNA-seq expression patterns of MADS-box genes in four different tissues revealed that more genes were highly expressed in flowers, which was confirmed by our quantitative RT-PCR results. There is no FLC and CO orthologs in pineapple. The loss of FLC and CO orthologs in pineapple indicated that modified flowering genes network in this tropical plant compared with Arabidopsis. The expression patterns of MADS-box genes in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic leaf tissues indicated the potential roles of some MADS-box genes in pineapple CAM photosynthesis. The 23% of pineapple MADS-box genes showed diurnal rhythm, indicating that these MADS-box genes are regulated by circadian clock.\nMADS-box genes identified in pineapple are closely related to flowering development. Some MADS-box genes are involved in CAM photosynthesis and regulated by the circadian clock. These findings will facilitate research on the development of unusual spiral inflorescences on pineapple fruit and CAM photosynthesis.\n","118":"\nCoturnix japonica (Japanese quail) has been extensively used as a model animal for biological studies. The Sox gene family, which was systematically characterized by a high-mobility group (HMG-box) in many animal species, encodes transcription factors that play central roles during multiple developmental processes. However, genome-wide investigations on the Sox gene family in birds are scarce. In the current study, we first performed a genome-wide study to explore the Sox gene family in galliform birds. Based on available genomic sequences retrieved from the NCBI database, we focused on the global identification of the Sox gene family in C. japonica and other species in Galliformes, and the evolutionary relationships of Sox genes. In our result, a total of 35 Sox genes in seven groups were identified in the C. japonica genome. Our results also revealed that dispersed gene duplications contributed the most to the expansion of the Sox gene family in Galliform birds. Evolutionary analyses indicated that Sox genes are an ancient gene family, and strong purifying selections played key roles in the evolution of CjSox genes of C. japonica. More interestingly, we observed that most Sox genes exhibited highly embryo-specific expression in both gonads. Our findings provided new insights into the molecular function and phylogeny of Sox gene family in birds.\n","119":"\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies without effective screening strategy during the early stage. Therefore, a novel screening panel was identified based on potential biomarkers associated with PDAC using the gene expression profile. The dataset GSE15471, which was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, included matching pairs of normal and tumor tissue samples from the resected pancreas of 39 pancreatic cancer patients. We used the online tool GEO2R to screen and pick out the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then we performed functional and pathway enrichment and constructed a DEG-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by searching interacting genes in STRING. By using the visualization software Cytoscape, we sorted the modules in the PPI network and hub genes of DEGs through the MCODE and CytoHubba plugins. In total, 326 DEGs, including 306 upregulated genes and 20 downregulated genes, were targeted in PDAC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway and gene ontology (GO), based on the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), revealed that the DEGs are mainly involved in 'PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,' 'Focal adhesion,' and 'ECM-receptor interaction.' In addition, top 50 core genes were identified from the PPI network by CytoHubba. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) survival analysis showed that high expressions of KRT7, KRT19, SEMA3C, ITGA2, MYOF, and ANXA1 may predict poor survival outcome in PDAC. Finally, Oncomine confirmed that the high expressions of these genes were strongly related to cancer grade. These hub genes and regulators straightened out the molecular pathways and recurrence mechanisms in PDAC and could be used as targets for PDAC's diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic prediction.\n","120":"\nVery long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) that are structural components of cell membrane lipid, cuticular waxes and seed oil, play crucial roles in plant growth, development and stress response. Fatty acid elongases (FAEs) comprising KCS and ELO, are key enzymes for VLCFA biosynthesis in plants. Although reference genomes of Brassica napus and its parental speices both have been sequenced, whole-genome analysis of FAE gene family in these Brassica speices is not reported. Here, 58, 33 and 30 KCS genes were identified in B. napus, B. rapa and B. oleracea genomes, respectively, whereas 14, 6 and 8 members were obtained for ELO genes. These KCS genes were unevenly located in 37 chromosomes and 3 scaffolds of 3 Brassica species, while these ELO genes were mapped to 19 chromosomes. The KCS and ELO proteins were divided into 8 and 4 subclasses, respectively. Gene structure and protein motifs remained highly conserved in each KCS or ELO subclass. Most promoters of KCS and ELO genes harbored various plant growth-, phytohormone-, and stress response-related cis-acting elements. 20 SSR loci existed in the KCS and ELO genes\/promoters. The whole-genome duplication and segmental duplication mainly contributed to expansion of KCS and ELO genes in these genomes. Transcriptome analysis showed that KCS and ELO genes in 3 Brassica species were expressed in various tissues\/organs with different levels, whereas 1 BnELO gene and 6 BnKCS genes might be pathogen-responsive genes. The qRT-PCR assay showed that BnKCS22 and BnELO04 responded to various phytohormone treatments and abiotic stresses. This work lays the foundation for further function identification of KCS and ELO genes in B. napus and its progenitors.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Valuable prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed for HCC. In this study, microarray data were downloaded from GSE14520, GSE22058, International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among GSE14520, GSE22058, and ICGC databases. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to establish gene co-expression modules of DEGs, and genes of key modules were examined to identify hub genes using univariate Cox regression in the ICGC cohort. Expression levels and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were determined to estimate the prognostic competence of the hub genes. These hub genes were also validated in the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and TCGA databases. TIMER algorithm and GSCALite database were applied to analyze the association of the hub genes with immunocytotic infiltration and their pathway enrichment. Altogether, 276 DEGs were identified and WGCNA described a unique and significantly DEGs-associated co-expression module containing 148 genes, with 10 hub genes selected by univariate Cox regression in the ICGC cohort (BIRC5, FOXM1, CENPA, KIF4A, DTYMK, PRC1, IGF2BP3, KIF2C, TRIP13, and TPX2). Most of the genes were validated in the GEPIA databases, except IGF2BP3. The results of multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the abovementioned hub genes are all independent predictors of HCC. The 10 genes were also confirmed to be associated with immune cell infiltration using the TIMER algorithm. Moreover, four-gene signature was developed, including BIRC5, CENPA, FOXM1, DTYMK. These hub genes and the model demonstrated a strong prognostic capability and are likely to be a therapeutic target for HCC. Moreover, the association of these genes with immune cell infiltration improves our understanding of the occurrence and development of HCC.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Wang, Liu, Liu and Li.\n","122":"\nAttention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) which may significantly impact on the affected individual's life. ADHD is acknowledged to have a high heritability component (70-80%). Recently, a meta-analysis of GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) has demonstrated the association of several independent loci. Our main aim here, is to apply PASCAL (pathway scoring algorithm), a new gene-based analysis (GBA) method, to the summary statistics obtained in this meta-analysis. PASCAL will take into account the linkage disequilibrium (LD) across genomic regions in a different way than the most commonly employed GBA methods (MAGMA or VEGAS (Versatile Gene-based Association Study)). In addition to PASCAL analysis a gene network and an enrichment analysis for KEGG and GO terms were carried out. Moreover, GENE2FUNC tool was employed to create gene expression heatmaps and to carry out a (DEG) (Differentially Expressed Gene) analysis using GTEX v7 and BrainSpan data.\nPASCAL results have revealed the association of new loci with ADHD and it has also highlighted other genes previously reported by MAGMA analysis. PASCAL was able to discover new associations at a gene level for ADHD: FEZF1 (p-value: 2.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910-\u20097) and FEZF1-AS1 (p-value: 4.58\u2009\u00d7\u200910-\u20097). In addition, PASCAL has been able to highlight association of other genes that share the same LD block with some previously reported ADHD susceptibility genes. Gene network analysis has revealed several interactors with the associated ADHD genes and different GO and KEGG terms have been associated. In addition, GENE2FUNC has demonstrated the existence of several up and down regulated expression clusters when the associated genes and their interactors were considered.\nPASCAL has been revealed as an efficient tool to extract additional information from previous GWAS using their summary statistics. This study has identified novel ADHD associated genes that were not previously reported when other GBA methods were employed. Moreover, a biological insight into the biological function of the ADHD associated genes across brain regions and neurodevelopmental stages is provided.\n","123":"\nRelative gene expression analyses by qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR) require an internal control to normalize the expression data of genes of interest and eliminate the unwanted variation introduced by sample preparation. A perfect reference gene should have a constant expression level under all the experimental conditions. However, the same few housekeeping genes selected from the literature or successfully used in previous unrelated experiments are often routinely used in new conditions without proper validation of their stability across treatments. The advent of RNA-Seq and the availability of public datasets for numerous organisms are opening the way to finding better reference genes for expression studies. Globodera rostochiensis is a plant-parasitic nematode that is particularly yield-limiting for potato. The aim of our study was to identify a reliable set of reference genes to study G. rostochiensis gene expression. Gene expression levels from an RNA-Seq database were used to identify putative reference genes and were validated with qRT-PCR analysis. Three genes, GR, PMP-3, and aaRS, were found to be very stable within the experimental conditions of this study and are proposed as reference genes for future work.\n","124":"\nAn unfavorable genetic correlation between milk production and fertility makes simultaneous improvement of milk production and fertility difficult in cattle breeding. Rapid genetic improvement in milk production traits in dairy cattle has been accompanied by decline in cow fertility. The genetic basis of this correlation remains poorly understood. Expanded reference populations and large sets of sequenced animals make genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with imputed markers possible for large populations and thereby studying genetic architecture of complex traits.\nIn this study, we associated 15,551,021 SNPs with female fertility index in 5038 Nordic Holstein cattle. We have identified seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) on six chromosomes in cattle. Along with nearest genes to GWAS hits, we used gene-based analysis and spread of linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to generate a list of potential candidate genes affecting fertility in cattle. Subsequently, we used prior knowledge on gene related to fertility from Gene Ontology terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, mammalian phenotype database, and public available RNA-seq data to refine the list of candidate genes for fertility. We used variant annotations to investigate candidate mutations within the prioritized candidate genes. Using multiple source of information, we proposed candidate genes with biological relevance underlying each of these seven QTL. On chromosome 1, we have identified ten candidate genes for two QTL. For the rest of chromosomes, we proposed one candidate gene for each QTL. In the candidate genes list, differentially expressed genes from different studies support FRAS1, ITGB5, ADCY5, and SEMA5B as candidate genes for cow fertility.\nThe GWAS result not only confirmed previously mapped QTL, but also made new findings. Our findings contributes towards dissecting the genetics for female fertility in cattle. Moreover, this study shows the usefulness of adding independent information to pick candidate genes during post-GWAS analysis.\n","125":"\nProstate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent urological malignancy in men worldwide. DNA methylation has an essential role in the etiology and pathogenesis of PCa. The purpose of the present study was to identify the aberrantly methylated\u2011differentially expressed genes and to determine their potential roles in PCa. The important node genes identified were screened by integrated analysis. Gene expression microarrays and gene methylation microarrays were downloaded and aberrantly methylated\u2011differentially expressed genes were obtained. Enrichment analysis and protein\u2011protein interactions (PPI) were obtained, their interactive and visual networks were created, and the node genes in the PPI network were validated. A total of 105 hypomethylation\u2011high expression genes and 561 hypermethylation\u2011low expression genes along with their biological processes were identified. The top 10 node genes obtained from the PPI network were identified for each of the two gene groups. The methylation and gene expression status of node genes in TCGA database, GEPIA tool, and the HPA database were generally consistent with those of our results. In conclusion, the present study identified 20 aberrantly methylated\u2011differentially expressed genes in PCa by combining bioinformatics analyses of gene expression and gene methylation microarrays, and concurrently, the survival of these genes was analyzed. Notably, methylation is a reversible biological process, which makes it of great biological significance for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer using bioinformatics technology to determine abnormal methylation gene markers. The present study provided novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of PCa.\n","126":"\nAeromonas sp. are opportunistic pathogenic bacteria which are associated with various diseases in ornamental fish, aquaculture raised species and wild fisheries. In our study, antimicrobial resistance patterns, antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integron gene cassettes of 52 guppy-borne Aeromonas sp. were examined. The isolates were identified as A. veronii (n\u00a0=\u00a034), A. dhakensis (n\u00a0=\u00a010), A. hydrophila (n\u00a0=\u00a03), A. caviae (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and A. enteropelogenes (n\u00a0=\u00a02) by gyrB gene sequencing. Every isolate was resistant to at least four antimicrobials in disc diffusion test. The resistance to amoxicillin, nalidixic acid and oxytetracycline was 100% among the tested isolates. 92\u00b730, 76\u00b792, 71\u00b715, 51\u00b792, 51\u00b792 and 50\u00b700% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, rifampicin, imipenem, cephalothin, tetracycline and trimethoprim respectively. The multiple antibiotic resistance index values ranged from 0\u00b728 to 0\u00b767. PCR amplification of antimicrobial resistance genes implied the occurrence of tetracycline resistance (tetA (65\u00b739%), tetE (25\u00b700%) and tetB (15\u00b738%)), plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (qnrS (26\u00b792%) and qnrB (17\u00b731%)) and aminoglycoside resistance (aphaAI-IAB (7\u00b769%) and aac (6')-Ib (3\u00b784%)) genes in the isolates. The IntI gene was positive for 36\u00b754% of the isolates and four class 1 integron gene cassette profiles (aadA2, qacE2-orfD, aadA2-catB2 and dfrA12-aadA2) were identified. These data suggest that ornamental guppy can be a reservoir of multidrug-resistant Aeromonas sp. which comprise different antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integrons. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Antimicrobial resistance genes and integron gene cassettes of ornamental fish-borne aeromonads are poorly studied. The antimicrobial resistance patterns, antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integron gene cassettes of Aeromonas sp. isolated from ornamental guppy were characterized for the first time in Korea. The incidence of different antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integron gene cassettes were observed in multidrug-resistant Aeromonas isolates. This result suggests that better management practices are necessary to prevent and address the serious consequences of indiscriminate and inappropriate antimicrobial use, and the distribution of multidrug-resistant bacteria.\n\u00a9 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.\n","127":"\nHeterosis, a phenomenon characterized by the superior performance of hybrid individuals relative to their parents, has been widely utilized in livestock and crop breeding, while the underlying genetic basis remains elusive in chickens. Here, we performed a reciprocal crossing experiment with broiler and layer chickens and conducted RNA sequencing on liver tissues for reciprocal crosses and their parental lines to identify inheritance patterns of gene expression. Our results showed that heterosis of the abdominal fat percentage was 69.28%-154.71% in reciprocal crosses. Over-dominant genes of reciprocal crosses were significantly enriched in three biological pathways, namely, butanoate metabolism, the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation. Among these shared over-dominant genes, we found that a lipid-related gene, HMGCL, was enriched in these pathways. Furthermore, we validated this gene as over-dominant using qRT-PCR. Although no shared significant pathway was detected in the high-parent dominant genes of reciprocal crosses, high-parent dominant gene expression was the major gene inheritance pattern in reciprocal crosses and we could not exclude the effect of high-parent dominant genes. These findings suggest that non-additive genes play important roles in the heterosis of important traits in chickens and have important implications regarding our understanding of heterosis.\n","128":"\nOsteosarcoma is the most common type of malignant bone cancer, which often affects teenagers and young adults. The present study aimed to screen for critical genes and microRNAs (miRNAs\/miRs) involved in osteosarcoma. A total of four microarray datasets (accession numbers GSE32981, GSE21257, GSE14827 and GSE14359) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Following data preprocessing, module analysis was performed to identify the stable modules using the weighted gene co\u2011expression network analysis\u00a0(WGCNA) package. The differentially expressed genes\u00a0(DEGs) between metastatic samples and non\u2011metastatic samples were screened, followed by gene co\u2011expression network construction, and Gene Ontology function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. Subsequently, prognosis\u2011associated genes were screened and a miRNA\u2011target gene regulatory network was constructed. Finally, the data for critical genes were validated. WGCNA analysis identified six modules; blue and yellow modules were significantly positively associated with osteosarcoma metastasis. A total of 1,613\u00a0DEGs were screened between primary tissue samples and metastatic samples. Following comparison of the genes in the two (blue and yellow) modules, a total of 166 DEGs were identified (metastatic samples vs. non\u2011metastatic samples). Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that these DEGs were mainly involved in 'defense response', 'p53 signaling pathway' and 'lysosome'. By utilizing the clinical information in GSE21257, 10 critical genes associated with osteosarcoma prognosis were obtained, including CTP synthase\u00a02 (CTPS2), tumor protein p53 inducible protein\u00a03\u00a0(TP53I3) and solute carrier family\u00a01 member\u00a01\u00a0(SLC1A1). In addition, hsa\u2011miR\u2011422a and hsa\u2011miR\u2011194 were highlighted in the miRNA\u2011target gene network. Finally, matrix metallopeptidase\u00a03\u00a0(MMP3) and vascular endothelial growth factor\u00a0B\u00a0(VEGFB) were predicted as critical genes in osteosarcoma metastasis. CTPS2, TP53I3 and SLC1A1 may serve major roles in osteosarcoma development, and hsa\u2011miR\u2011422a, hsa\u2011miR\u2011194, MMP3 and VEGFB may be associated with osteosarcoma metastasis.\n","129":"\nOGEE is an Online GEne Essentiality database. To enhance our understanding of the essentiality of genes, in OGEE we collected experimentally tested essential and non-essential genes, as well as associated gene properties known to contribute to gene essentiality. We focus on large-scale experiments, and complement our data with text-mining results. We organized tested genes into data sets according to their sources, and tagged those with variable essentiality statuses across data sets as conditionally essential genes, intending to highlight the complex interplay between gene functions and environments\/experimental perturbations. Developments since the last public release include increased numbers of species and gene essentiality data sets, inclusion of non-coding essential sequences and genes with intermediate essentiality statuses. In addition, we included 16 essentiality data sets from cancer cell lines, corresponding to 9 human cancers; with OGEE, users can easily explore the shared and differentially essential genes within and between cancer types. These genes, especially those derived from cell lines that are similar to tumor samples, could reveal the oncogenic drivers, paralogous gene expression pattern and chromosomal structure of the corresponding cancer types, and can be further screened to identify targets for cancer therapy and\/or new drug development.

Various metazoan species have greatly different numbers of genes in ASCa, ASCb and ASCc families. To explore evolutionary mechanisms of metazoan ASC genes, Blast (basic local alignment search tool) searches and phylogenetic analyses were conducted to identify ASC genes in metazoan species and to infer phylogenetic relationship between various ASC genes. As a result, 2784 ASC genes were identified in 804 metazoan species. The phylogenetic tree constructed using 1237 unique bHLH motifs shows that metazoan ASCa, ASCb and ASCc families contain six (a1-a6), five (b1-b5) and three (c1-c3) bHLH genes, respectively. Further phylogenetic analyses suggest that ASC genes in metazoans are derived from a primitive c gene, those in insects are derived from c2 gene, and those in chordates are derived from a2 and a3 genes. Data of gene linkage demonstrate that insect a6 is derived from a4 but not from a5, and chordate a2 is ancestral to b5 only, whilst a3 is ancestral to both b3 and b5. It is concluded that current ASC gene families in metazoans were established through a series of sub- and\/or neo-functionalization to duplicated ancestral ASC gene(s). These results provide good references for exploring evolutionary mechanisms of other bHLH genes in metazoans. Besides, gene subtyping is considered as an efficient method for evolutionary studies on closely related homologous genes.\n","131":"\nGene expression profiles are increasingly applied to investigate molecular mechanism for which, normalization with suitable reference genes is critical. Previously we have reported several suitable reference genes for laticifer samples from rubber tree, however, little is known in leaf. The main objective of this current study was to identify some stable expression reference genes at various developmental stages of leaf, as well as during abiotic (high and low temperature extremes) and biotic stresses (pathogen stress). Gene expression profilings identified the ubiquitin-proteasome system as excellent potential as reference genes for rubber tree leaf. Among a total of 30 tested genes investigated, 24 new candidate (including 11 genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system), 4 previously identified and 2 specific genes, were further evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR. Our results indicated that the new candidate genes had better expression stability comparing with others. For instance, an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (RG0099) and three ubiquitin-protein ligases (RG0928, RG2190 and RG0118) expressed stably in all samples, and were confirmed to be suitable reference genes for rubber tree leaf under four different conditions. Finally, we suggest that using more than one reference gene may be appropriate in gene expression studies when employing different software to normalize gene expression data. Our findings have significant implications for the reliability of data obtained from genomics studies in rubber tree and perhaps in other species.\n","132":"\nWhen considering the evolution of a gene's expression profile, we commonly assume that this is unaffected by its genomic neighborhood. This is, however, in contrast to what we know about the lack of autonomy between neighboring genes in gene expression profiles in extant taxa. Indeed, in all eukaryotic genomes genes of similar expression-profile tend to cluster, reflecting chromatin level dynamics. Does it follow that if a gene increases expression in a particular lineage then the genomic neighbors will also increase in their expression or is gene expression evolution autonomous? To address this here we consider evolution of human gene expression since the human-chimp common ancestor, allowing for both variation in estimation of current expression level and error in Bayesian estimation of the ancestral state. We find that in all tissues and both sexes, the change in gene expression of a focal gene on average predicts the change in gene expression of neighbors. The effect is highly pronounced in the immediate vicinity (<100 kb) but extends much further. Sex-specific expression change is also genomically clustered. As genes increasing their expression in humans tend to avoid nuclear lamina domains and be enriched for the gene activator 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, we conclude that, most probably owing to chromatin level control of gene expression, a change in gene expression of one gene likely affects the expression evolution of neighbors, what we term expression piggybacking, an analog of hitchhiking. \n\u00a9 The Author 2015.

ZN016 is a landrace vegetable cowpea highly resistant to rust. Two previous studies using mixed-spores inoculation suggested different modes of inheritance of rust resistance in ZN016. In this study, we initially developed a detached leaf assay with a purified single-rust isolate (Auv-LS). Using this approach, we assessed the inheritance of rust resistance in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population and an F2 population, both derived from the cross of \"ZN016\" and the susceptible cultivar \"Zhijiang282.\" A single dominant gene mode against Auv-LS was revealed in both populations. QTL mapping showed that this gene was coincident with the Ruv2 locus on LG7, one of the three resistance QTLs previously mapped based on mixed-spores inoculation data. Therefore, Ruv2 was considered as specifically against the rust isolate Auv-LS. Through an analysis of the RIL recombinants at Ruv2, we fine-mapped the gene to an ~\u20090.45-cM interval between SNP markers 2_09656 and 2_00973, which corresponded to an ~\u2009193-kb region on chromosome 2 that harboured 23 predicted gene models enriched with NBS-type genes. Re-sequencing of the two parents revealed polymorphisms in four genes predictively to cause substantial protein structural changes, rendering them valuable candidate genes for future validation. Cross-species syntenic analysis indicated that Ruv2 may represent a novel rust resistance gene in food legumes. A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences marker tightly linked to Ruv2 was developed to facilitate breeding. This work establishes a basis for map-based cloning of Ruv2 and breeding for rust resistance in cowpea and other legume crops.\n","134":"\nElymus nutans and E. sibiricus are two important forage grasses of the genus Elymus. But they are difficult to grow for commercial seed production due to serious seed shattering. We conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of abscission zone to find possible transcription changes associated with seed shattering, explore candidate genes involved in seed shattering and identify candidate gene-based EST-SSR markers for germplasm evaluation.\ncDNA libraries from abscission zone (AZ) and non-abscission zone (NAZ) tissues of E. nutans were constructed and sequenced. A total of 111,667 unigenes were annotated and 7644 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) were predicted, corresponding to 6936 up-regulated in AZ and 708 down-regulated in NAZ. We identified 489 candidate genes related to transcription factor, cell wall hydrolysis or modification, hydrolase activity, phytohormone signaling and response, lignin biosynthesis, and signal transduction or protein turnover. Eleven similar candidate genes involved in polygalacturonase activity, hydrolase activity, and mitogen-activated protein kinase were up-regulated in the abscission zone of the two Elymus species, suggesting these genes may have specific function for abscission zone development and seed shattering. A total of 67 polymorphic EST-SSR markers were developed and characterized based on the sequences of these candidate genes. Fourteen polymorphic EST-SSR primers were finally used to study genetic diversity in 48 E. nutans genotypes with contrasting seed shattering habit. The dendrogram based on molecular data showed that most accessions with similar seed shattering degree tended to group together.\nThe expression data generated from this study provides an important resource for future molecular biological research. Many DETs were associated with abscission zone development, and EST-SSR loci related to candidate genes may have potential application in identifying trait-associated markers in E. nutans in the future.\n","135":"\nHulless barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum. hook. f.) has been cultivated as a major crop in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau of China for thousands of years. Compared to other cereal crops, the Tibetan hulless barley has developed stronger endogenous resistances to survive in the severe environment of its habitat. To understand the unique resistant mechanisms of this plant, detailed genetic studies need to be performed. The quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the most commonly used method in detecting gene expression. However, the selection of stable reference genes under limited experimental conditions was considered to be an essential step for obtaining accurate results in qRT-PCR. In this study, 10 candidate reference genes-ACT (Actin), E2 (Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 2), TUB\u03b1 (Alpha-tubulin), TUB\u03b26 (Beta-tubulin 6), GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), EF-1\u03b1 (Elongation factor 1-alpha), SAMDC (S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase), PKABA1 (Gene for protein kinase HvPKABA1), PGK (Phosphoglycerate kinase), and HSP90 (Heat shock protein 90)-were selected from the NCBI gene database of barley. Following qRT-PCR amplifications of all candidate reference genes in Tibetan hulless barley seedlings under various stressed conditions, the stabilities of these candidates were analyzed by three individual software packages including geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results demonstrated that TUB\u03b26, E2, TUB\u03b1, and HSP90 were generally the most suitable sets under all tested conditions; similarly, TUB\u03b1 and HSP90 showed peak stability under salt stress, TUB\u03b1 and EF-1\u03b1 were the most suitable reference genes under cold stress, and ACT and E2 were the most stable under drought stress. Finally, a known circadian gene CCA1 was used to verify the service ability of chosen reference genes. The results confirmed that all recommended reference genes by the three software were suitable for gene expression analysis under tested stress conditions by the qRT-PCR method.\n","136":"\nRapid adaptation\/accommodation to changing environments largely contributes to maximal survival of invaders during biological invasions, usually leading to success in crossing multiple barriers and finally in varied environments in recipient habitats. Gene expression is one of the most important and rapid ways during responses to environmental stresses. Selection of proper reference genes is the crucial prerequisite for gene expression analysis using the common approach, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Here we identified eight candidate novel reference genes from the RNA-Seq data in an invasive model ascidian Ciona savignyi under temperature and salinity stresses. Subsequently, the expression stability of these eight novel reference genes, as well as other six traditionally used reference genes, was evaluated using RT-qPCR and comprehensive tool RefFinder. Under the temperature stress, two traditional reference genes, ribosomal proteins S15 and L17 (RPS15, RPL17), and one novel gene Ras homolog A (RhoA), were recommended as the top three stable genes, which can be used to normalize target genes with a high and moderate expression level, respectively. Under the salinity stress, transmembrane 9 superfamily member (TMN), MOB kinase activator 1A-like gene (MOB) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBQ2) were suggested as the top three stable genes. On the other hand, several commonly used reference genes such as \u03b1-tubulin (TubA), \u03b2-tubulin (TubB) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) showed unstable expressions, thus these genes should not be used as internal controls for gene expression analysis. We also tested the expression level of an important stress response gene, large proline-rich protein bag6-like gene (BAG) using different reference genes. As expected, we observed different results and conclusions when using different normalization methods, thus suggesting the importance of selection of proper reference genes and associated normalization methods. Our results provide a valuable reference gene resource for the normalization of gene expression in the study of environmental adaptation\/accommodation during biological invasions using C. savignyi as a model.\n","137":"\nMining patterns of co-expressed genes across the subset of conditions help to narrow down the search space for the analysis of gene expression data. Identifying conditions specific key genes from the large-scale gene expression data is a challenging task. The conditions specific key gene signifies functional behavior of a group of co-expressed genes across the subset of conditions and can be act as biomarkers of the diseases. In this paper, we have propose a novel approach for identification of conditions specific key genes from Basal-Like Breast Cancer (BLBC) disease using biclustering algorithm and Gene Co-expression Network (GCN). The proposed approach is a two-stage approach. In the first stage, significant biclusters have been extracted with the help of 'runibic' biclustering algorithm. The second stage identifies conditions specific key genes from the extracted significant biclusters with the help of GCN. By using difference matrix and gene correlation matrix, we have constructed biologically meaningful and statistically strong GCN. Also, presented the proposed approach with the help of a process diagram and demonstrated the procedure with an example of bicluster number 93 (Bic93). From the experimental results, we observed that 95% and 85% of the extracted biclusters are found to be biologically significant at the p-values less than 0.05 and 0.01 respectively. We have compared proposed approach with the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) based approach. From the comparison, our approach has performed effectively and extracted biologically significant biclusters. Also, identified conditions specific key genes which cannot be extracted using the WGCNA based approach. Some of the important identified known key genes are PIK3CA, SHC3, ERBB2, SHC4, PTOV1, STAG1, ZNF215 etc. These key genes can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for the BLBC disease after the rigorous analysis. The identified conditions specific key genes can be helpful to reduce the analysis time and increase the accuracy of further research such as biomarker identification, drug target discovery etc.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study predicted hub genes and gene functions for PO by an integration of the convergent evidence (CE) method, rank product (RP) algorithm and the combing of P-values. Using the gene expression data, genes were ranked by the CE method, RP algorithm and combing P-values, respectively. Subsequently, the top 100 genes were selected from each of the three gene lists, and then the common genes for two or three methods were denoted as informative genes of PO. A mutual information network (MIN) was constructed for the informative genes utilizing the context likelihood of relatedness algorithm. Topological centrality (degree) analysis was conducted on the MIN to investigate hub genes. Then we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis dependent upon the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool (BiNGO) plugin of Cytoscape to investigate hub gene functions for PO patients. Consequently, a total of 82 informative genes were obtained by integrating the results of the three methods. There were 82 nodes and 1,741 edges in the MIN, of which 8 hub genes were identified, such as PFN1, EEF2 and S100A9. The result of GO enrichment analysis showed that 49 GO terms with P<0.001 were detected, especially the top 5 gene sets were defined as hub gene functions of PO, for instance, translational elongation, translation and cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process. In conclusion, we have predicted 8 hub genes and 5 hub gene functions associated with PO patients.

Here, the natural variation of 13 root and 3 shoot traits was evaluated in 297 maize inbred lines and genome-wide association mapping was conducted to identify SNPs associated with target traits. All measured traits exhibited 2.02- to 21.36-fold variations. A total of 34 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected for 13 traits, and each individual QTL explained 5.7% to 15.9% of the phenotypic variance. Three pleiotropic QTLs involving five root traits were identified; SNP_2_104416607 was associated with lateral root length (LRL), root surface area (RA), root length between 0 and 0.5mm in diameter (RL005), and total root length (TRL); SNP_2_184016997 was associated with RV and RA, and SNP_4_168917747 was associated with LRL, RA and TRL. The expression levels of candidate genes in root QTLs were evaluated by RNA-seq among three long-root lines and three short-root lines. A total of five genes that showed differential expression between the long- and short-root lines were identified as promising candidate genes for the target traits.

Non-target-site resistance to this herbicide is governed by a range of genes involved in herbicide stress response. To enable reliable measurement of gene expression levels in herbicide-resistant and susceptible plants it is necessary to normalize qPCR data using internal control genes with stable expression. In an attempt to find the best reference genes, the stability of seven candidate reference genes was assessed in plants resistant and susceptible to 2,4-D, subjected or not to herbicide stress. Using three statistical algorithms (geNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder), the overall results revealed that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actin and ubiquitin were the most stable reference genes. The normalization expression levels of GH3 (indole-3-acetic acid amido synthetase) and GST3 (glutathione S-transferase) which are two genes up-regulated following 2,4-D treatment, were determined to verify the stability of these selected reference genes. A sudden increase in GH3 and GST3 expression was already detected 5h after herbicide application, confirming their involvement in plant response to 2,4-D. The validation results confirmed the applicability and accuracy of these reference genes. This study identified and validated reference genes in the non-model weed species P. rhoeas and these will facilitate gene expression analysis studies aimed at identifying functional genes associated with non-target-site resistance.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we investigated the expression stability of 14 candidate reference genes (RGs) across various organs exposed to five abiotic stresses (cold, heat, drought, salt, and poly-metals). Four RGs ranking algorithms, namely geNormPLUS, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and GrayNorm were applied to analyze the qPCR data and the outputs were merged into consensus lists with RankAggreg, a rank aggregation algorithm. In addition, the optimal RG combinations were determined with geNormPLUS and GrayNorm. The genes that were the most stable in the roots were TIP41 and CDC2. In the leaves, TIP41 was the most stable, followed by EF1b and ARI8, depending on the condition tested. Conversely, GAPDH and \u03b2-TUB, two genes commonly used for qPCR data normalization were the least stable across all organs. Nevertheless, both geNormPLUS and GrayNorm recommended the use of a combination of genes rather than a single one.

The K\u2011B method was applied for the determination of drug resistance of Shigella\u00a0flexneri, and polymerase chain reaction amplification was used for class 1, 2 and\u00a03 integrase genes. Enzyme digestion and sequence analysis were performed for the variable regions of positive strains. Based on the drug sensitivity assessment, multi\u2011drug resistant strains that were resistant to five or more antibiotics, and sensitive strains were selected for amplification. Their active efflux pump genes, acrA and acrB, and regulatory genes, marOR, acrR and soxS, were selected for sequencing. The results revealed that 91.1% of the 158 strains were multi\u2011resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and 69.6% of the strains were multi\u2011resistant to sulfamethoxazole\/trimethoprim. The resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was <32.9%. All strains (100%) were sensitive to cefoxitin, cefoperazone\/sulbactam and imipenem. The rate of the class 1 integron positivity was 91.9% (144\/158). Among these class 1 integron\u2011positive strains, 18 strains exhibited the resistance gene cassette dfrV in the variable region of the strain, four strains exhibited dfrA17\u2011aadA5 in the variable region and 140 strains exhibited blaOXA\u201130\u2011aadA1 in the variable region. Four strains showed no resistance gene in the variable regions. The rate of class 2 integron positivity was 86.1% (136\/158), and all positive strains harboured the dfrA1\u2011sat1\u2011aadA resistance gene cassette in the variable region.

In Fusarium oxysporum, one family of effectors, the Secreted In Xylem (SIX) genes, has been identified. We sought to characterize the diversity and evolution of the SIX genes in the banana-infecting lineages of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). Whole-genome sequencing data were generated for the 23 genetic lineages of Foc, which were subsequently queried for the 14 known SIX genes (SIX1-SIX14). The sequences of the identified SIX genes were confirmed in a larger collection of Foc isolates. Genealogies were generated for each of the SIX genes identified in Foc to further investigate the evolution of the SIX genes in Foc. Within Foc, variation of the SIX gene profile, including the presence of specific SIX homologues, correlated with the pathogenic race structure of Foc. Furthermore, the topologies of the SIX gene trees were discordant with the topology of an infraspecies phylogeny inferred from EF-1\u03b1\/RPB1\/RPB2 (translation elongation factor-1\u03b1\/RNA polymerase II subunit I\/RNA polymerase II subunit II). A series of topological constraint models provided strong evidence for the horizontal transmission of SIX genes in Foc. The horizontal inheritance of pathogenicity genes in Foc counters previous assumptions that convergent evolution has driven the polyphyletic phylogeny of Foc. This work has significant implications for the management of Foc, including the improvement of diagnostics and breeding programmes.\n\u00a9 2017 BSPP AND JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.\n","144":"\nThe genetic interactions in the circadian rhythm biological system are promising as a source of pathophysiology in mood disorder.

In this study, an AVR-gene-based diagnosis tool for determining the virulence spectrum of a rice blast pathogen population was developed and validated. A set of 77 single-spore field isolates was subjected to pathotype analysis using differential lines, each containing a single R gene, and classified into 20 virulent pathotypes, except for 4 isolates that lost pathogenicity. In all, 10 differential lines showed low frequency (<24%) of resistance whereas 8 lines showed a high frequency (>95%), inferring the effectiveness of R genes present in the respective differential lines. In addition, the haplotypes of seven AVR genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing, if applicable. The calculated frequency of different AVR genes displayed significant variations in the population. AVRPiz-t and AVR-Pii were detected in 100 and 84.9% of the isolates, respectively. Five AVR genes such as AVR-Pik-D (20.5%) and AVR-Pik-E (1.4%), AVRPiz-t (2.7%), AVR-Pita (0%), AVR-Pia (0%), and AVR1-CO39 (0%) displayed low or even zero frequency. The frequency of AVR genes correlated almost perfectly with the resistance frequency of the cognate R genes in differential lines, except for International Rice Research Institute-bred blast-resistant lines IRBLzt-T, IRBLta-K1, and IRBLkp-K60. Both genetic analysis and molecular marker validation revealed an additional R gene, most likely Pi19 or its allele, in these three differential lines. This can explain the spuriously higher resistance frequency of each target R gene based on conventional pathotyping. This study demonstrates that AVR-gene-based diagnosis provides a precise, R-gene-specific, and differential line-free assessment method that can be used for determining the virulence spectrum of a rice blast pathogen population and for predicting the effectiveness of target R genes in rice varieties.\n","147":"\nPseudomonas brassicacearum GS20 is an antagonistic strain of bacteria recently isolated from the rhizosphere of Codonopsis pilosula.

To minimize methodological errors, a reference gene (or a combination of reference genes) is routinely used for normalization to account for technical variables such as RNA quality and sample size. While presumed to have stable expression, reference genes in the brain can change during normal development, as well as in response to injury, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study is the first to evaluate the stability of reference genes in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model in the pediatric mouse brain, using two methods of qPCR normalization for optimal reference gene selection. Three week old mice were subjected to unilateral CCI at two severity of injuries (mild or severe), compared to sham controls. At 1 and 8 weeks post-injury, the ipsilateral hemisphere was analyzed to determine reference gene stability. Five commonly-used reference genes were compared: tyrosine 3 monooxygenase\/tryptophan 5\u2009monooxygenase activation protein zeta (Ywhaz), cyclophilin A (Ppia), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) and \u03b2-actin (Actb). Ppia and Hprt were chosen as the most stable combination of genes using GeNORM software analysis. These results highlight the instability of several commonly used reference genes after TBI, and provide a selection of validated genes for future gene expression analyses in the injured pediatric mouse brain.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, RNA is a very versatile molecule and its abundance is tissue-dependent. RNA quantification is dependent on a reference control to estimate the abundance. Additionally, in cancer, many cellular processes are deregulated which consequently affects the gene expression profiles. In this work, we performed microarray data mining of different childhood cancers and healthy controls. We selected four genes that showed no gene expression variations (PSMB6, PGGT1B, UBQLN2 and UQCR2) and four classical reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, RPL4 and RPS18). Gene expression was validated in 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples by means of droplet digital PCR. We observed that PSMB6, PGGT1B, UBQLN2 and UQCR2 were expressed ~100 times less than ACTB, GAPDH, RPL4 and RPS18. However, we observed excellent correlations among the new reference genes (p < 0.0001). We propose that PSMB6, PGGT1B, UBQLN2 and UQCR2 are housekeeping genes with low expression in childhood cancer.\n","150":"\nGenome-wide identification, expression analysis and potential functional characterization of previously uncharacterized MADS family of tartary buckwheat, emphasized the importance of this gene family in plant growth and development. The MADS transcription factor is a key regulatory factor in the development of most plants. The MADS gene in plants controls all aspects of tissue and organ growth and reproduction and can be used to regulate plant seed cracking. However, there has been little research on the MADS genes of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum), which is an important edible and medicinal crop. The recently published whole genome sequence of tartary buckwheat allows us to study the tissue and expression profiles of the MADS gene in tartary buckwheat at a genome-wide level. In this study, 65 MADS genes of tartary buckwheat were identified and renamed according to the chromosomal distribution of the FtMADS genes. Here, we provide a complete overview of the gene structure, gene expression, genomic mapping, protein motif organization, and phylogenetic relationships of each member of the gene family. According to the phylogenetic relationship of MADS genes, the transcription factor family was divided into two subfamilies, the M subfamily (28 genes) and the MIKC subfamily (37 genes). The results showed that the FtMADS genes belonged to related sister pairs and the chromosomal map showed that the replication of FtMADSs was related to the replication of chromosome blocks. In different tissues and at different fruit development stages, the FtMADS genes obtained by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed obvious expression patterns. A comprehensive analysis of the MADS genes in tartary buckwheat was conducted. Through systematic analysis, the potential genes that may regulate the growth and development of tartary buckwheat and the genes that may regulate the easy dehulling of tartary buckwheat fruit were screened, which laid a solid foundation for improving the quality of tartary buckwheat.\n","151":"\nSulfur mustard (SM) is a destructive and harmful chemical agent for the eyes, skin and lungs that causes short-term and long-term lesions and was widely used in Iraq war against Iran (1980-1988).

Selenium (Se) deficiency is closely related to KD, while magnesium (Mg) plays many critical roles in the cardiovascular function. The molecular mechanism of KD pathogenesis is still unclear. Until now, we have not found any studies investigating the association between Se- or Mg-related genes and KD. In this study, oligonucleotide microarray analysis was used to identify the differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells between KD patients and normal controls. Next, human metabolome database (HMDB) was used to screen Se- and Mg-related genes. Function classification, gene pathway, and interaction network of Se- and Mg-related genes in KD peripheral blood mononuclear cells were defined by FunRich (functional enrichment analysis tool). Among 83 differentially expressed genes, five Se-related (DIO2, GPX1, GPX2, GPX4, and GPX7) and five Mg-related (ACSL6, EYA4, IDH2, PPM1A, and STK11) genes were recognized from HMDB. Two significant biological processes (energy pathways and metabolism), one molecular function (peroxidase activity), one biological pathway (glutathione redox reactions I), and one gene interaction network were constituted from Se-related and Mg-related genes. Se-related gene DIO2 and Mg-related genes STK11 and IDH2 may have key roles in the myocardial dysfunction of KD. However, we still have not obtained any interaction between Se-related gene and Mg-related gene. The interactions between RPS6KB1, PTEN, ATM, HSP90AA1, SNRK, PRKAA2, SMARCA4, HSPA1A, and STK11 may play important roles in the abnormal cardiac function of KD.\n","153":"\nThe generation of chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum \u00d7 morifolium) flower color is mainly attributed to the accumulation of anthocyanins. In the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in chrysanthemum, although all of the structural genes have been cloned, the regulatory function of R2R3-MYB transcription factor (TF) genes, which play a crucial role in determining anthocyanin accumulation in many ornamental crops, still remains unclear. In our previous study, four light-induced R2R3-MYB TF genes in chrysanthemum were identified using transcriptomic sequencing. In the present study, we further investigated the regulatory functions of these genes via phylogenetic and alignment analyses of amino acid sequences, which were subsequently verified by phenotypic, pigmental, and structural gene expression analyses in transgenic tobacco lines. As revealed by phylogenetic and alignment analyses, CmMYB4 and CmMYB5 were phenylpropanoid and flavonoid repressor R2R3-MYB genes, respectively, while CmMYB6 was an activator of anthocyanin biosynthesis, and CmMYB7 was involved in regulating flavonol biosynthesis. Compared with wild-type plants, the relative anthocyanin contents in the 35S:CmMYB4 and 35S:CmMYB5 tobacco lines significantly decreased (p < 0.05), while for 35S:CmMYB6 and 35S:CmMYB7, the opposite result was obtained. Both in the 35S:CmMYB4 and 35S:CmMYB5 lines, the relative expression of several anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in tobacco was significantly downregulated (p < 0.05); on the contrary, several genes were upregulated in the 35S:CmMYB6 and 35S:CmMYB7 lines. These results indicate that CmMYB4 and CmMYB5 negatively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in chrysanthemum, while CmMYB6 and CmMYB7 play a positive role, which will aid in understanding the complex mechanism regulating floral pigmentation in chrysanthemum and the functional divergence of the R2R3-MYB gene family in higher plants.\n","154":"\nBackground: Prostate cancer (PCa)is a malignancy of the urinary system with a high incidence, which is the second most common male cancer in the world. There are still huge challenges in the treatment of prostate cancer. It is urgent to screen out potential key biomarkers for the pathogenesis and prognosis of PCa. Methods: Multiple gene differential expression profile datasets of PCa tissues and normal prostate tissues were integrated analysis by R software. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the overlapping Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) were performed. The STRING online database was used in conjunction with Cytospace software for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to define hub genes. The relative mRNA expression of hub genes was detected in Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database. A prognostic gene signature was identified by Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results: Three hundred twelve up-regulated genes and 85 down-regulated genes were identified from three gene expression profiles (GSE69223, GSE3325, GSE55945) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) dataset. Seven hub genes (FGF2, FLNA, FLNC, VCL, CAV1, ACTC1, and MYLK) further were detected, which related to the pathogenesis of PCa. Seven prognostic genes (BCO1, BAIAP2L2, C7, AP000844.2, ASB9, MKI67P1, and TMEM272) were screened to construct a prognostic gene signature, which shows good predictive power for survival by the ROC curve analysis.

Here, we have globally analyzed enhancer elements bound by IL-2-activated STAT5 and IL-21-activated STAT3 in T cells and identified Il2ra as the top-ranked gene regulated by an IL-2-activated STAT5-bound superenhancer and one of the top genes regulated by STAT3-bound superenhancers. Moreover, we found that STAT5 binding was rapidly superenriched at genes highly induced by IL-2 and that IL-2-activated STAT5 binding induces new and augmented chromatin interactions within superenhancer-containing genes. Based on chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag (ChIA-PET) sequencing data, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to target three of the STAT5 binding sites within the Il2ra superenhancer in mice. Each mutation decreased STAT5 binding and altered IL-2-induced Il2ra gene expression, revealing that individual elements within the superenhancer were not functionally redundant and that all were required for normal gene expression. Thus, we demonstrate cooperative utilization of superenhancer elements to optimize gene expression and show that STAT5 mediates IL-2-induced chromatin looping at superenhancers to preferentially regulate highly inducible genes, thereby providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cytokine-dependent superenhancer function.\n","156":"\nAeromonas spp. are Gram-negative opportunistic bacteria which have been commonly associated with fish diseases. In this study, antibiogram, antimicrobial resistance genes and integrons of 43 zebrafish-borne Aeromonas spp. were studied. The isolates were identified as six Aeromonas species (A. veronii biovar veronii (n\u00a0=\u00a026), A. veronii biovar sobria (n\u00a0=\u00a03), A. hydrophila (n\u00a0=\u00a08), A. caviae (n\u00a0=\u00a03), A. enteropelogenes (n\u00a0=\u00a02) and A. dhakensis (n\u00a0=\u00a01)). Antibiogram of the isolates indicated that most of them were resistant to amoxicillin (100\u00b700%), nalidixic acid (100\u00b700%), oxytetracycline (100\u00b700%), ampicillin (93\u00b702%), tetracycline (74\u00b742%), rifampicin (67\u00b744%) and imipenem (65\u00b715%). Multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) index values ranged from 0\u00b719-0\u00b744 to 90\u00b770% isolates showed multidrug resistance. PCR of antimicrobial resistance genes revealed that the tetracycline resistance gene (tetA) was the most predominant (67\u00b744%) among the isolates. The qnrS (53\u00b749%), tetB (30\u00b723%), tetE (30\u00b723%), qnrB (23\u00b726%) and aac(6')-Ib-cr (4\u00b765%) genes were also detected. Class 1 integrase (IntI1) gene was found in 46\u00b751% of the isolates. Two types of class 1 integron gene cassette profiles (qacG-aadA6-qacG and drfA1) were identified. The results showed that zebrafish-borne aeromonads can harbour different types of antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integrons. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Aeromonas spp. are important pathogens found in diverse environments. Antimicrobial resistance genes and integrons of ornamental fish-borne Aeromonas spp. are not well studied. The antibiogram, antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integrons of Aeromonas spp. isolated from zebrafish were characterized for the first time in Korea. The prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes and class 1 integron gene cassettes were observed among the isolates. The qacG-aadA6-qacG gene cassette was identified for the first time in Aeromonas spp. The results suggest that the wise use of antimicrobials is necessary for the better management of the ornamental fish.\n\u00a9 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.\n","157":"\nThis is the first study which describes a unique procedure of isolating of high-quality, intact RNA from strawberry leaves of Xanthomonas fragariae, three most suitable reference genes, crucial for the normalization of RT-qPCR data for this pathogen and accurate expression analysis of target genes.

This gene cluster has important roles in male fertility based on phenotypic defects of Rhox-mutant mice and the finding that aberrant RHOX promoter methylation is strongly associated with abnormal human sperm parameters. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of RHOX function in humans. Using gene expression profiling, we identified genes regulated by members of the human RHOX gene cluster. Some genes were uniquely regulated by RHOXF1 or RHOXF2\/2B, while others were regulated by both of these transcription factors. Several of these regulated genes encode proteins involved in processes relevant to spermatogenesis; e.g. stress protection and cell survival. One of the target genes of RHOXF2\/2B is RHOXF1, suggesting cross-regulation to enhance transcriptional responses. The potential role of RHOX in human infertility was addressed by sequencing all RHOX exons in a group of 250 patients with severe oligozoospermia. This revealed two mutations in RHOXF1 (c.515G\u2009>\u2009A and c.522C\u2009>\u2009T) and four in RHOXF2\/2B (-73C\u2009>\u2009G, c.202G\u2009>\u2009A, c.411C\u2009>\u2009T and c.679G\u2009>\u2009A), of which only one (c.202G\u2009>\u2009A) was found in a control group of men with normal sperm concentration. Functional analysis demonstrated that c.202G\u2009>\u2009A and c.679G\u2009>\u2009A significantly impaired the ability of RHOXF2\/2B to regulate downstream genes. Molecular modelling suggested that these mutations alter RHOXF2\/F2B protein conformation. By combining clinical data with in vitro functional analysis, we demonstrate how the X-linked RHOX gene cluster may function in normal human spermatogenesis and we provide evidence that it is impaired in human male fertility.\n","159":"\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common of the neurodegenerative diseases. Recent diagnostic criteria have defined a preclinical disease phase during which neuropathological substrates are thought to be present in the brain.

We selected a cohort of 100 subjects (controls\u2009=\u200947; preclinical AD\u2009=\u200911; patients with AD\u2009=\u200942) and analyzed whole blood expression of 20 genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The selected genes belonged to calcium signaling, senescence and autophagy, and mitochondria\/oxidative stress pathways. Additionally, two genes associated with an increased risk of developing AD (clusterin (CLU) and bridging integrator 1 (BIN1)) were also analyzed. We detected significantly different gene expressions of BECN1 and PRKCB between the control and the AD groups and of CDKN2A between the control and the preclinical AD groups. Notably, these three genes are also considered tumor suppressor (CDKN2A and BECN1) or tumor promoter (PRKCB) genes. Gene-gene expression Pearson correlations were computed separately for controls and patients with AD. The significant correlations (p\u2009<\u20090.001) were represented in a network analysis with Cytoscape tool, which suggested an uncoupling of mitochondria-related genes in AD group.

Goji (Lycium barbarum L.) is a multi-branched shrub belonging to the Solanaceae family. To date, no systematic screening or evaluation of reference gene(s) in Goji has been performed. In this work, we identified 18 candidate reference genes from the transcriptomic sequencing data of 14 samples of Goji at different developmental stages and under drought stress condition. The expression stability of these candidate genes was rigorously analyzed using qRT-PCR and four different statistical algorithms: geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and RefFinder. Two novel reference genes LbCML38 and LbRH52 showed the most stable expression, whereas the traditionally used reference genes such as LbGAPDH, LbHSP90 and LbTUB showed unstable expression in the tested samples. Expression of a target gene LbMYB1 was also tested and compared using optimal reference genes LbCML38 and LbRH52, mediocre reference gene LbActin7, and poor reference gene LbHSP90 as normalization standards, respectively. As expected, calculation of the target gene expression by normalization against LbCML38, LbActin7 or LbHSP90 showed significant differences. Our findings suggest that LbCML38 and LbRH52 can be used as reference genes for gene expression analysis in Goji.\n","161":"\nThis study takes a whole-transcriptome approach to assess gene expression changes in response to glyphosate treatment in glyphosate-resistant fleabane. We assessed gene expression changes in both susceptible and resistant lines so that the glyphosate death response could be quantified, and constitutively expressed candidate resistance genes identified. There are three copies of the glyphosate target site (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate; EPSPS) gene in Conyza and because Conyza bonariensis is allohexaploid, there is a baseline nine copies of the gene in any individual.\nMany genes were differentially expressed in response to glyphosate treatment. Known resistance mutations are present in EPSPS2 but they are present in a glyphosate-susceptible line as well as resistant lines and therefore not sufficient to confer resistance. EPSPS1 is expressed four times more than EPSPS2, further reducing the overall contribution of these mutations.\nWe demonstrate that glyphosate resistance in C. bonariensis is not the result of EPSPS mutations or overexpression, but due to a non-target-site mechanism. A large number of genes are affected by glyphosate treatment.

The number of inter-species (including inter-subgenera) hybrids has increased as a result of broadening the genetic basis for stress (biotic and abiotic) resistance\/tolerance. Identifying genes associated with important traits and responses requires expression analysis. Relative quantification is the simplest and most popular alternative, which requires reference genes (housekeeping) to normalize RT-qPCR data. However, there is a scarcity of validated housekeeping genes for hybrid Prunus rootstock species. This research aims to increase the number of housekeeping genes suitable for Prunus rootstock expression analysis. Twenty-one candidate housekeeping genes were pre-selected from previous RNAseq data that compared the response of root transcriptomes of two rootstocks subgenera to hypoxia treatment, 'Mariana 2624' (P. cerasifera Ehrh.\u00d7 P. munsoniana W. Wight & Hedrick), and 'Mazzard F12\/1' (P. avium L.). Representing groups of low, intermediate or high levels of expression, the genes were assayed by RT-qPCR at 72 hours of hypoxia treatment and analyzed with NormFinder software. A sub-set of seven housekeeping genes that presented the highest level of stability were selected, two with low levels of expression (Unknown 3, Unknown 7) and five with medium levels (GTB 1, TUA 3, ATPase P, PRT 6, RP II). The stability of these genes was evaluated under different stress conditions, cold and heat with the hybrid 'Mariana 2624' and N nutrition with the hybrids 'Colt' (P. avium \u00d7 P. pseudocerasus Lindl.) and 'Garnem' [P. dulcis Mill.\u00d7 (P. persica L.\u00d7 P. davidiana Carr.)]. The algorithms of geNorm and BestKeeper software also were used to analyze the performance of these genes as housekeepers. Stability rankings varied according to treatments, genotypes and the software for evaluation, but the gene GBT 1 often had the highest ranking. However, most of the genes are suitable depending on the stressor and\/or genotype to be evaluated. No optimal number of reference genes could be determined with geNorm software when all conditions and genotypes were considered. These results strongly suggest that relative RT-qPCR should be analyzed separately with their respective best housekeeper according to the treatment and\/or genotypes in Prunus spp. rootstocks.\n","163":"\nGene expression studies are indispensable for investigation and elucidation of molecular mechanisms.

We were able to identify eight genes (ALB, B4GALT6, GAPDH, HMBS, YWHAZ, ABCA5, ABCA9, and ABCC1) which demonstrated no altered gene expression levels in all tested conditions and therefore represent good candidates for the standardization of gene expression studies in altered gravity. \n","164":"\nEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common malignancy with high mortality.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained and we then performed with Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis as well as protein-protein interactions (PPI) network analysis. WGCNA was used to construct the co-expression network. Multipart results were intersected to acquire the candidate genes, and survival analysis was used to identify the hub genes. RESULTS A total of 568 DEGs, including 272 upregulated genes and 296 downregulated genes, were identified. GO and pathway analyses revealed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM), ECM organization, structural constituent of muscle, and ECM-receptor interaction. The PPI network of DEGs was established, comprising 428 nodes and 1944 edges. In the co-expression network, pink module was the key module, in which 34 genes with high connectivity were identified. After the intersection of multipart results, 24 common genes were chosen as the candidate genes, among which 7 hub genes (PLAU, SERPINE1, LAMC2, ITGA5, TGFBI, FSCN1, and HLF) were identified using survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS Seven potential biomarkers were identified as being closely related with the initiation and prognosis of OSCC and might serve as potential targets for early diagnosis and personalized therapy of OSCC.\n","166":"\nCurrently, more than 150 million people worldwide suffer from lymphedema. It is a chronic progressive disease characterized by high-protein edema of various parts of the body due to defects in lymphatic drainage. Molecular-genetic mechanisms of the disease are still poorly understood. Beginning of a clinical manifestation of primary lymphedema in middle age and the development of secondary lymphedema after treatment of breast cancer can be genetically determined. Disruption of endothelial cell apoptosis can be considered as one of the factors contributing to the development of lymphedema. However, a study of the relationship between genes associated with lymphedema and genes involved in endothelial apoptosis, in the associative gene network was not previously conducted.\nIn the current work, we used well-known methods (ToppGene and Endeavour), as well as methods previously developed by us, to prioritize genes involved in endothelial apoptosis and to find potential participants of molecular-genetic mechanisms of lymphedema among them. Original methods of prioritization took into account the overrepresented Gene Ontology biological processes, the centrality of vertices in the associative gene network, describing the interactions of endothelial apoptosis genes with genes associated with lymphedema, and the association of the analyzed genes with diseases that are comorbid to lymphedema.\nAn assessment of the quality of prioritization was performed using criteria, which involved an analysis of the enrichment of the top-most priority genes by genes, which are known to have simultaneous interactions with lymphedema and endothelial cell apoptosis, as well as by genes differentially expressed in murine model of lymphedema. In particular, among genes involved in endothelial apoptosis, KDR, TNF, TEK, BMPR2, SERPINE1, IL10, CD40LG, CCL2, FASLG and ABL1 had the highest priority. The identified priority genes can be considered as candidates for genotyping in the studies involving the search for associations with lymphedema.\nAnalysis of interactions of these genes in the associative gene network of lymphedema can improve understanding of mechanisms of interaction between endothelial apoptosis and lymphangiogenesis, and shed light on the role of disturbance of these processes in the development of edema, chronic inflammation and connective tissue transformation during the progression of the disease.\n","167":"\nWheat, a major worldwide staple food crop, is relatively sensitive to a changing environment, including high temperature. The comprehensive mechanism of heat stress response at the molecular level and exploitation of candidate tolerant genes are far from enough.

A total of 1705 and 17 commonly differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in wheat grain and flag leaf, respectively, through transcriptome analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment were also applied to illustrate the functions and metabolic pathways of DEGs involved in thermotolerance of wheat grain and flag leaf. Furthermore, our data suggest that there may be a more complex molecular mechanism or tighter regulatory network in flag leaf than in grain under heat stress over time, as less commonly DEGs, more discrete expression profiles of genes (principle component analysis) and less similar pathway response were observed in flag leaf. In addition, we found that transcriptional regulation of zeatin, brassinosteroid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways may play an important role in wheat's heat tolerance. The expression changes of some genes were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and three potential genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis process were identified.\n","168":"\nOperon-like arrangements of genes occur in eukaryotes ranging from yeasts and filamentous fungi to nematodes, plants, and mammals. In plants, several examples of operon-like gene clusters involved in metabolic pathways have recently been characterized, e.g. the cyclic hydroxamic acid pathways in maize, the avenacin biosynthesis gene clusters in oat, the thalianol pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana, and the diterpenoid momilactone cluster in rice. Such operon-like gene clusters are defined by their co-regulation or neighboring positions within immediate vicinity of chromosomal regions. A comprehensive analysis of the expression of neighboring genes therefore accounts a crucial step to reveal the complete set of operon-like gene clusters within a genome. Genome-wide prediction of operon-like gene clusters should contribute to functional annotation efforts and provide novel insight into evolutionary aspects acquiring certain biological functions as well. We predicted co-expressed gene clusters by comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient of neighboring genes and randomly selected gene pairs, based on a statistical method that takes false discovery rate (FDR) into consideration for 1469 microarray gene expression datasets of A. thaliana. We estimated that A. thaliana contains 100 operon-like gene clusters in total. We predicted 34 statistically significant gene clusters consisting of 3 to 22 genes each, based on a stringent FDR threshold of 0.1. Functional relationships among genes in individual clusters were estimated by sequence similarity and functional annotation of genes. Duplicated gene pairs (determined based on BLAST with a cutoff of E<10(-5)) are included in 27 clusters. Five clusters are associated with metabolism, containing P450 genes restricted to the Brassica family and predicted to be involved in secondary metabolism. Operon-like clusters tend to include genes encoding bio-machinery associated with ribosomes, the ubiquitin\/proteasome system, secondary metabolic pathways, lipid and fatty-acid metabolism, and the lipid transfer system.\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is urgent to find an effective way to understand the genetic etiology of OA. We used weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to explore the key genes involved in the subchondral bone pathological process of OA. Fifty gene expression profiles of GSE51588 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The OA-associated genes and gene ontologies were acquired from JuniorDoc. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to find disease-related networks based on 21756 gene expression correlation coefficients, hub-genes with the highest connectivity in each module were selected, and the correlation between module eigengene and clinical traits was calculated. The genes in the traits-related gene coexpression modules were subject to functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis using ClusterProfiler. A total of 73 gene modules were identified, of which, 12 modules were found with high connectivity with clinical traits. Five modules were found with enriched OA-associated genes. Moreover, 310 OA-associated genes were found, and 34 of them were among hub-genes in each module. Consequently, enrichment results indicated some key metabolic pathways, such as extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction (hsa04512), focal adhesion (hsa04510), the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway (PI3K-AKT) (hsa04151), transforming growth factor beta pathway, and Wnt pathway. We intended to identify some core genes, collagen (COL)6A3, COL6A1, ITGA11, BAMBI, and HCK, which could influence downstream signaling pathways once they were activated. In this study, we identified important genes within key coexpression modules, which associate with a pathological process of subchondral bone in OA. Functional analysis results could provide important information to understand the mechanism of OA.\n\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","170":"\nBACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers in the world. Bioinformatics studies have been widely used for screening genes involved in the initiation and progression of HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS We obtained liver cancer microarray raw data from the GEO database (GSE54238). Next, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to assess the critical modules. Then, we assessed the gene significance by calculating survival, expression level, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in the TCGA database. We also validated the expression of selected genes in the Oncomine database and calculated the relationship between 4 hub genes and immune infiltration. Finally, GSEA enrichment analysis was used to explore the potential mechanism. RESULTS We identified the red and blue modules as the critical modules, and found 176 candidate genes by assessing gene significance. GO and KEEG results suggested that the candidate genes are involved in the cell cycle. Four hub genes - SOX4, STK39, TARBP1, and TDRKH - were eventually screened after validating their expression and power in diagnosing HCC in the TCGA database. Immune infiltration analysis and GSEA enrichment analysis showed that these 4 hub genes were correlated with the immune cell populations infiltration and that multiple mechanisms were involved, such as angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. CONCLUSIONS Our findings revealed that these 4 genes can be regarded as potential prognosticators and therapeutic targets for HCC.\n","171":"\nOssification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a kind of disease with physical barriers and neurological disorders. The objective of this study was to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OPLL patient ligament cells and identify the target sites for the prevention and treatment of OPLL in clinic. Gene expression data GSE5464 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus; then DEGs were screened by limma package in R language, and changed functions and pathways of OPLL cells compared to normal cells were identified by DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery); finally, an interaction network of DEGs was constructed by string. A total of 1536 DEGs were screened, with 31 down-regulated and 1505 up-regulated genes. Response to wounding function and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway may involve in the development of OPLL. Genes, such as PDGFB, PRDX2 may involve in OPLL through response to wounding function. Toll-like receptor signaling pathway enriched genes such as TLR1, TLR5, and TLR7 may involve in spine cord injury in OPLL. PIK3R1 was the hub gene in the network of DEGs with the highest degree; INSR was one of the most closely related genes of it. OPLL related genes screened by microarray gene expression profiling and bioinformatics analysis may be helpful for elucidating the mechanism of OPLL. \n\u00a9 2013.\n","172":"\nTeak, a member of the Lamiaceae family, produces one of the most expensive hardwoods in the world. High demand coupled with deforestation have caused a decrease in natural teak forests, and future supplies will be reliant on teak plantations. Hence, selection of teak tree varieties for clonal propagation with superior growth performance is of great importance, and access to high-quality genetic and genomic resources can accelerate the selection process by identifying genes underlying desired traits.\nTo facilitate teak research and variety improvement, we generated a highly contiguous, chromosomal-scale genome assembly using high-coverage Pacific Biosciences long reads coupled with high-throughput chromatin conformation capture. Of the 18 teak chromosomes, we generated 17 near-complete pseudomolecules with one chromosome present as two chromosome arm scaffolds. Genome annotation yielded 31,168 genes encoding 46,826 gene models, of which, 39,930 and 41,155 had Pfam domain and expression evidence, respectively. We identified 14 clusters of tandem-duplicated terpene synthases (TPSs), genes central to the biosynthesis of terpenes, which are involved in plant defense and pollinator attraction. Transcriptome analysis revealed 10 TPSs highly expressed in woody tissues, of which, 8 were in tandem, revealing the importance of resolving tandemly duplicated genes and the quality of the assembly and annotation. We also validated the enzymatic activity of four TPSs to demonstrate the function of key TPSs.\nIn summary, this high-quality chromosomal-scale assembly and functional annotation of the teak genome will facilitate the discovery of candidate genes related to traits critical for sustainable production of teak and for anti-insecticidal natural products.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.

The selection of a suitable reference gene for normalization is critical for the accuracy of quantitative results. Peripheral nerve injury is a common clinical disorder that affects multiple tissues and organs, including peripheral nerves, neurons and the innervated muscles. Numerous genes are differentially expressed in skeletal muscles during muscle denervation and reinnervation following peripheral nerve injury. The identification of a suitable reference gene in innervated muscles following nerve injury may improve the understanding of the alterations in gene expression in the processes of peripheral nerve repair and regeneration. Therefore, in the present study, by using a rat sciatic nerve crush model, the expression levels of various housekeeping genes were examined. In particular, the expression levels of 13 housekeeping genes, including 18S ribosomal RNA, actin \u03b2, ankyrin repeat domain 27, cyclophilin\u00a0A, GAPDH, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L10, phosphoglycerate kinase\u00a01, RPTOR independent companion of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2, TATA\u2011box binding protein, ubiquitin C, UBX domain protein 11 and tyrosine 3\u2011monooxygenase\/tryptophan 5\u2011monooxygenase activation protein \u03b6, were investigated in gastrocnemius muscles. The geNorm and NormFinder analyses suggested that the expression level of HPRT1 was particularly stable in gastrocnemius muscles following rat sciatic nerve crush injury. Therefore, HPRT1 may be used as a reference gene for the normalization of gene expression data generated by RT\u2011qPCR.\n","174":"\nSyncytin-1 and syncytin-2 which are endogenous retroviral genes products play a great role in syncytialization during trophoblast differentiation in normal placental tissues. In aneuploidic placentas due to the low level of pregnancy-induced hormones an alteration was occurred in the syncytialization process, while in the presence of cytogenetically abnormal karyotype the effect of syncytin gene expression levels on syncytialization process and in occured to spontaneous abortions is not clear. To reveal this, we investigated in syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 genes expression levels of chromosomally abnormal and normal trophophoblastic tissues and we also discussed the effect of the syncytin gene expression levels to the occurense of the spontaneous abortion.\nTo each one of the trophoblastic cells; cultivation, harvesting, banding, and analysis were performed and the chromosomes were classified according to the presence of abnormality and normal XY constitution. To exclude the maternal decidual cell contamination, female karyotyped abortion materials were omitted in control group. The patient group consisted of thirty six placental tissues including trisomy 16 (n\u00a0=\u00a010), triploidy (n\u00a0=\u00a09), monosomy\u00a0X\u00a0(n\u00a0=\u00a09), trisomy 21 (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and trisomy 7 (n\u00a0=\u00a03). The control group was consisting twenty placental tissues with XY karyotypes. The some part of the dissected frozen trophoblastic cells were used for RNA isolation and were proceeded to the determination of the expression levels of syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 genes by single-step Real Time PCR. The cDNAs were obtained by probes used in the same PCR stages. The sequence analysis of the syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 genes were performed, and read by the usage of the FinchTV 1.4.0 program.\nBetween the expression levels of syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 genes were statistically difference in the patients and controls. There was a difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) between trisomy 7 and other patient groups and controls, regarding to the expression of syncytin-1 gene. Numerous mutations in the syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 genes (on the expression sites) were detected, and the mutation rate was higher in the syncytin-1 gene compared to the syncytin-2 gene in the patient and in the control groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe results of the study indicate that the expression of the syncytin-2 genes could be altered in the presence of chromosomally abnormal trophoblastic tissues, and these could lead to the loss of pregnancy due to the insufficient syncytialization. In sum, the current research has value for the further studies covering the mechanisms of trophoblast cell fusion, and syncytiotrophoblast regeneration, and thus the pathophysiology of human placental development in the presence of genomic anomaly.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This strategy consists in transferring human genes into respiratory chain-deficient fibroblasts, followed by a metabolic selection in a highly selective medium. We used a normalized expression cDNA library in an episomal vector (pREP4) to transfect the fibroblasts, and a medium with glutamine and devoid of any carbohydrate source to select metabolically. Growing the patient's fibroblasts in this selective medium, the deficient cells rapidly disappear unless they are rescued by the cDNA of a suppressor gene. The use of an episomal vector allows us to carry out several rounds of transfection\/selection (cyclical phenotypic rescue) to enrich the rescue with true clones of suppressor genes. Using fibroblasts from a patient with epileptic encephalopathy with the m.3946G>A (p.E214K) mutation in the MT-ND1 gene, several candidate genes were identified and one of them was characterized functionally. Thus, overexpression of MRPS18C gene (that encode for bS18m protein) suppressed the molecular defects produced by this mtDNA mutation, recovering the complex I activity and reducing the ROS produced by this complex to normal levels. We suggest that modulation of bS18m expression may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the patients with this mutation.\n","176":"\nThis study aims to identify the changes in expression of hypoxia-inducible genes in seven different cancer cell lines that vary in their oxygen levels in an attempt to identify hypoxia biomarkers that can be targeted in therapy.

Pleotropic pathways that play a role in inducing hypoxia directly such as HIF1 \u03b1 and NF-kB pathways were upregulated. In addition, genes expressed only in the severe hypoxic liver and pancreatic cells indicate that severe and intermediate hypoxic cancer cells vary in their gene expression.

Hence, which genes undergo duplication and are preserved following duplication is an important question. It has been observed that gene duplicability, or the ability of genes to be retained following duplication, is a nonrandom process, with certain genes being more amenable to survive duplication events than others. Primarily, gene essentiality and the type of duplication (small-scale versus large-scale) have been shown in different species to influence the (long-term) survival of novel genes. However, an overarching view of \"gene duplicability\" is lacking, mainly due to the fact that previous studies usually focused on individual species and did not account for the influence of genomic context and the time of duplication. Here, we present a large-scale study in which we investigated duplicate retention for 9178 gene families shared between 37 flowering plant species, referred to as angiosperm core gene families. For most gene families, we observe a strikingly consistent pattern of gene duplicability across species, with gene families being either primarily single-copy or multicopy in all species. An intermediate class contains gene families that are often retained in duplicate for periods extending to tens of millions of years after whole-genome duplication, but ultimately appear to be largely restored to singleton status, suggesting that these genes may be dosage balance sensitive. The distinction between single-copy and multicopy gene families is reflected in their functional annotation, with single-copy genes being mainly involved in the maintenance of genome stability and organelle function and multicopy genes in signaling, transport, and metabolism. The intermediate class was overrepresented in regulatory genes, further suggesting that these represent putative dosage-balance-sensitive genes. \n\u00a9 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

We systematically identified coexpression modules using the weighted gene coexpression network analysis method (WGCNA). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were performed on the modules deemed important. The protein-protein interaction networks were constructed and visualized using Cytoscape software on the basis of the STRING website; the hub genes in the top weighted network were identified. Survival data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared using the log-rank test.\nSeven coexpression modules consisting of different genes were applied to 5,000 genes in the 121 human MCL samples using WGCNA software. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis identified the blue module as one of the most important modules; the most critical pathways identified were the ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation and proteasome pathways.

Then, we studied collective gene interaction patterns and uncovered highly interwoven network communities as the building blocks of the GRN. One community, composed of mostly unknown genes interacting with opaque2, brittle endosperm1 and shrunken2, contributes to seed phenotypes. Another community, composed mostly of genes expressed in the basal endosperm transfer layer, is responsible for nutrient transport. We further integrated our inferred GRN with gene expression patterns in different seed compartments and at various developmental stages and pathways.

However, driver gene discovery is a very challenging task because we are not only dealing with huge amount of data; but we are also faced with the complexity of the disease including the heterogeneity of background somatic mutation rate in each cancer patient. It is generally accepted that CDG harbor variants conferring growth advantage in the malignant cell and they are positively selected, which are critical to cancer development; whereas, non-driver genes harbor random mutations with no functional consequence on cancer. Based on this fact, function prediction based approaches for identifying CDG have been proposed to interrogate the distribution of functional predictions among mutations in cancer genomes (eLS 1-16, 2016). Assuming most of the observed mutations are passenger mutations and given the quantitative predictions for the functional impact of the mutations, genes enriched of functional or deleterious mutations are more likely to be drivers. The promises of these methods have been continually refined and can therefore be applied to increase accuracy in detecting new candidate CDGs. However, current function prediction based approaches only focus on coding mutations and lack a systematic way to pick the best mutation deleteriousness prediction algorithms for usage.\nIn this study, we propose a new function prediction based approach to discover CDGs through a gene-based permutation approach. Our method not only covers both coding and non-coding regions of the genes; but it also accounts for the heterogeneous mutational context in cohort of cancer patients. The permutation model was implemented independently using seven popular deleteriousness prediction scores covering splicing regions (SPIDEX), coding regions (MetaLR, and VEST3) and pan-genome (CADD, DANN, Fathmm-MKL coding and Fathmm-MKL noncoding). We applied this new approach to somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from whole-genome sequences of 119 breast and 24 lung cancer patients and compared the seven deleteriousness prediction scores for their performance in this study.\nThe new function prediction based approach not only predicted known cancer genes listed in the Cancer Gene Census (CGC), but also new candidate CDGs that are worth further investigation. The results showed the advantage of utilizing pan-genome deleteriousness prediction scores in function prediction based methods. Although VEST3 score, a deleteriousness prediction score for missense mutations, has the best performance in breast cancer, it was topped by CADD and Fathmm-MKL coding, two pan-genome deleteriousness prediction scores, in lung cancer.\n","184":"\nThe Zn(II)\u2082Cys\u2086 zinc cluster gene family is a subclass of zinc-finger proteins, which are transcriptional regulators involved in a wide variety of biological processes in fungi.

Based on the structures of the C6 zinc domains, these proteins were observed to be evolutionarily conserved in ascomycete fungi. We focused on T.guangdongense, a medicinal fungus, and identified 139 C6 zinc genes which could be divided into three groups. Among them, 49.6% belonged to the fungal specific transcriptional factors, and 16% had a DUF3468 domain. Homologous and phylogenetic analysis indicated that 29 C6 zinc genes were possibly involved in the metabolic process, while five C6 zinc genes were supposed to be involved in asexual or sexual development. Gene expression analysis revealed that 54 C6 zinc genes were differentially expressed under light, including two genes that possibly influenced the development, and seven genes that possibly influenced the metabolic processes. This indicated that light may affect the development and metabolic processes, at least partially, through the regulation of C6 zinc genes in T.guangdongense.

One important way of discovering such co-regulations is the query-based search since gene co-expressions may indicate a shared role in a biological process. Although there exist promising query-driven search methods adapting clustering, they fail to capture many genes that function in the same biological pathway because microarray datasets are fraught with spurious samples or samples of diverse origin, or the pathways might be regulated under only a subset of samples. On the other hand, a class of clustering algorithms known as biclustering algorithms which simultaneously cluster both the items and their features are useful while analyzing gene expression data, or any data in which items are related in only a subset of their samples. This means that genes need not be related in all samples to be clustered together. Because many genes only interact under specific circumstances, biclustering may recover the relationships that traditional clustering algorithms can easily miss.

While various computational methods have been proposed for disease gene prediction, with the recent increasing availability of biological information for genes, it is highly motivated to leverage these valuable data sources and extract useful information for accurately predicting disease genes.\nWe present an integrative framework called N2VKO to predict disease genes. Firstly, we learn the node embeddings from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for genes by adapting the well-known representation learning method node2vec. Secondly, we combine the learned node embeddings with various biological annotations as rich feature representation for genes, and subsequently build binary classification models for disease gene prediction. Finally, as the data for disease gene prediction is usually imbalanced (i.e. the number of the causative genes for a specific disease is much less than that of its non-causative genes), we further address this serious data imbalance issue by applying oversampling techniques for imbalance data correction to improve the prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed N2VKO significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art methods for disease gene prediction across seven diseases.\nIn this study, we show that node embeddings learned from PPI networks work well for disease gene prediction, while integrating node embeddings with other biological annotations further improves the performance of classification models. Moreover, oversampling techniques for imbalance correction further enhances the prediction performance. In addition, the literature search of predicted disease genes also shows the effectiveness of our proposed N2VKO framework for disease gene prediction.\n","187":"\nGene regulation is central for growth, development, and adaptation to environmental changes in all living organisms. Many genes are induced by environmental cues, and the expression of these inducible genes is often repressed under normal conditions. Here, we show that the SHINY2 (SHI2) gene is important for repressing salt-inducible genes and also plays a role in cold response. The shi2 mutant displayed hypersensitivity to cold, abscisic acid (ABA), and LiCl. Map-based cloning demonstrates that SHI2 encodes a DEAD- (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box RNA helicase with similarity to a yeast splicing factor. Transcriptomic analysis of the shi2 mutant in response to cold revealed that the shi2 mutation decreased the number of cold-responsive genes and the magnitude of their response, and resulted in the mis-splicing of some cold-responsive genes. Under salt stress, however, the shi2 mutation increased the number of salt-responsive genes but had a negligible effect on mRNA splicing. Our results suggest that SHI2 is a component in a ready-for-transcription repressor complex important for gene repression under normal conditions, and for gene activation and transcription under stress conditions. In addition, SHI2 also serves as a splicing factor required for proper splicing of cold-responsive genes and affects 5' capping and polyadenylation site selection.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.

In a prior study, we used an integrated systems biology tool to identify a group of 39 acid-associated genes from the fruit transcriptomes in four sweet orange varieties (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) with varying fruit acidity, Succari (acidless), Bingtang (low acid), and Newhall and Xinhui (normal acid).\nWe reanalyzed the prior sweet orange fruit transcriptome data, leading to the identification of 72 genes highly correlated with the fruit\u00a0sugar\/acid ratio. The majority of these sugar\/acid ratio-related genes are predicted to be involved in regulatory functions such as transport, signaling and transcription or encode enzymes involved in metabolism. Surprisingly, only three of these sugar\/acid ratio-correlated genes are weakly correlated with sugar level and none of them overlaps with the acid-associated genes. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) has revealed that these genes belong to four modules, Blue, Grey, Brown and Turquoise, with the former two modules being unique to the sugar\/acid ratio control.\nOur results indicate that orange fruits contain a possible mechanistically distinct class of genes that may potentially be involved in maintaining fruit sugar\/acid ratios and\/or responding to the cellular sugar\/acid ratio status.

Gene expression study revealed significant variability in expression of the BjSUS paralogs across the different tissues. BjSUS genes showed transcriptional activation in response to defense hormones and a late response to wounding. Tissue and temporal specificity of expression revealed importance of specific SUS paralogs at different developmental stages and under different stress conditions. The study highlighted differential involvement of SUS paralogs in sucrose metabolism across the tissues and stress-responses, in a major oilseed crop B. juncea.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Considering that the caudal hindbrain is relatively complex - for instance, unique sets of neurons are formed in each rhombomere segment - it is likely that additional essential genes remain to be identified and integrated into the caudal hindbrain GRN.\nBy taking advantage of gene expression data available in the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN), we identified 84 uncharacterized genes that are expressed in r4-r6. We selected a representative set of 22 genes and assayed their expression patterns in hoxb1b, hoxb1a, hnf1b, and valentino mutants with the goal of positioning them in the caudal hindbrain GRN. We also investigated the effects of RA and FGF on the expression of this gene set. To examine whether these genes are necessary for r4-r6 development, we analyzed germline mutants for six of the genes (gas6, gbx1, sall4, eglf6, celf2, and greb1l) for defects in hindbrain development.\nOur results reveal that r4 gene expression is unaffected by the individual loss of hoxb1b, hoxb1a or RA, but is under the combinatorial regulation of RA together with hoxb1b. In contrast, r5\/r6 gene expression is dependent on RA, FGF, hnf1ba and valentino - as individual loss of these factors abolishes r5\/r6 gene expression. Our analysis of six mutant lines did not reveal rhombomere or neuronal defects, but transcriptome analysis of one line (gas6 mutant) identified expression changes for genes involved in several developmental processes - suggesting that these genes may have subtle roles in hindbrain development.\nWe conclude that r4-r6 formation is relatively robust, such that very few genes are absolutely required for this process. However, there are mechanistic differences in r4 versus r5\/r6, such that no single factor is required for r4 development while several genes are individually required for r5\/r6 formation.\n","191":"\nRegulation of gene expression is an important mechanism through which genetic variation can affect complex traits. A substantial portion of gene expression variation can be explained by both local (cis) and distal (trans) genetic variation. Much progress has been made in uncovering cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL), but trans-eQTL have been more difficult to identify and replicate. Here we take advantage of our ability to predict the cis component of gene expression coupled with gene mapping methods such as PrediXcan to identify high confidence candidate trans-acting genes and their targets. That is, we correlate the cis component of gene expression with observed expression of genes in different chromosomes. Leveraging the shared cis-acting regulation across tissues, we combine the evidence of association across all available\u00a0Genotype-Tissue Expression Project tissues and find 2,356 trans-acting\/target gene pairs with high mappability scores. Reassuringly, trans-acting genes are enriched in transcription and nucleic acid binding pathways and target genes are enriched in known transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, trans-acting genes are more significantly associated with selected complex traits and diseases than target or background genes, consistent with percolating trans effects. Our scripts and summary statistics are publicly available for future studies of trans-acting gene regulation.\n\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

These processes when perturbed are thought to contribute to schizophrenia pathophysiology. A core feature of schizophrenia is cognitive dysfunction. For genetic disorders where cognitive impairment is more severe such as intellectual disability, there are a disproportionally high number of genes involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Evidence now supports some shared genetic aetiology between schizophrenia and intellectual disability. GWAS have identified 108 chromosomal regions associated with schizophrenia risk that span 350 genes. This study identified genes mapping to those loci that have epigenetic functions, and tested the risk alleles defining those loci for association with cognitive deficits. We developed a list of 350 genes with epigenetic functions and cross-referenced this with the GWAS loci. This identified eight candidate genes: BCL11B, CHD7, EP300, EPC2, GATAD2A, KDM3B, RERE, SATB2. Using a dataset of Irish psychosis cases and controls (n\u2009=\u20091235), the schizophrenia risk SNPs at these loci were tested for effects on IQ, working memory, episodic memory, and attention. Strongest associations were for rs6984242 with both measures of IQ (P\u2009=\u20090.001) and episodic memory (P\u2009=\u20090.007). We link rs6984242 to CHD7 via a long range eQTL. These associations were not replicated in independent samples. Our study highlights that a number of genes mapping to risk loci for schizophrenia may function as epigenetic regulators of gene expression but further studies are required to establish a role for these genes in cognition. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","193":"\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a deficiency in the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2\/neu genes. Patients with TNBC have an increased likelihood of distant recurrence and mortality, compared with patients with other subtypes of breast cancer. The current study aimed to identify novel biomarkers for TNBC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to construct gene co-expression networks; these were used to explore the correlation between mRNA profiles and clinical data, thus identifying the most significant co-expression network associated with the American Joint Committee on Cancer-TNM stage of TNBC. Using RNAseq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas, downloaded from the University of California, Santa Cruz, WGCNA identified 23 modules via K-means clustering. The most significant module consisted of 248 genes, on which gene ontology analysis was subsequently performed. Differently Expressed Gene (DEG) analysis was then applied to determine the DEGs between normal and tumor tissues. A total of 42 genes were positioned in the overlap between DEGs and the most significant module. Following survival analysis, 5 genes [GIPC PDZ domain containing family member 1 (GIPC1), hes family bHLH transcription factor 6 (HES6), calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein family member 3 (KIAA1543), myosin light chain kinase 2 (MYLK2) and peter pan homolog (PPAN)] were selected and their association with the American Joint Committee on Cancer-TNM diagnostic stage was investigated. The expression level of these genes in different pathological stages varied, but tended to increase in more advanced pathological stages. The expression of these 5 genes exhibited accurate capacity for the identification of tumor and normal tissues via receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. High expression of GIPC1, HES6, KIAA1543, MYLK2 and PPAN resulted in poor overall survival (OS) in patients with TNBC. In conclusion, via unsupervised clustering methods, a co-expressed gene network with high inter-connectivity was constructed, and 5 genes were identified as biomarkers for TNBC.\nCopyright: \u00a9 Bao et al.\n","194":"\nCancer is a complex disease which is characterized by the accumulation of genetic alterations during the patient's lifetime. With the development of the next-generation sequencing technology, multiple omics data, such as cancer genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data etc., can be measured from each individual. Correspondingly, one of the key challenges is to pinpoint functional driver mutations or pathways, which contributes to tumorigenesis, from millions of functional neutral passenger mutations.\nIn this paper, in order to identify driver genes effectively, we applied a generalized additive model to mutation profiles to filter genes with long length and constructed a new gene-gene interaction network. Then we integrated the mutation data and expression data into the gene-gene interaction network. Lastly, greedy algorithm was used to prioritize candidate driver genes from the integrated data. We named the proposed method Length-Net-Driver (LNDriver).\nExperiments on three TCGA datasets, i.e., head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma, demonstrated that the proposed method was effective. Also, it can identify not only frequently mutated drivers, but also rare candidate driver genes.\n","195":"\nPhytophthora sojae Kaufmann and Gerdemann, which causes Phytophthora root rot, is a widespread pathogen that limits soybean production worldwide. Development of Phytophthora resistant cultivars carrying Phytophthora resistance Rps genes is a cost-effective approach in controlling this disease. For this mapping study of a novel Rps gene, 290 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (F7 families) were developed by crossing the P. sojae resistant cultivar PI399036 with the P. sojae susceptible AR2 line, and were phenotyped for responses to a mixture of three P. sojae isolates that overcome most of the known Rps genes. Of these 290 RILs, 130 were homozygous resistant, 12 heterzygous and segregating for Phytophthora resistance, and 148 were recessive homozygous and susceptible. From this population, 59 RILs homozygous for Phytophthora sojae resistance and 61 susceptible to a mixture of P. sojae isolates R17 and Val12-11 or P7074 that overcome resistance encoded by known Rps genes mapped to Chromosome 18 were selected for mapping novel Rps gene. A single gene accounted for the 1:1 segregation of resistance and susceptibility among the RILs. The gene encoding the Phytophthora resistance mapped to a 5.8 cM interval between the SSR markers BARCSOYSSR_18_1840 and Sat_064 located in the lower arm of Chromosome 18. The gene is mapped 2.2 cM proximal to the NBSRps4\/6-like sequence that was reported to co-segregate with the Phytophthora resistance genes Rps4 and Rps6. The gene is mapped to a highly recombinogenic, gene-rich genomic region carrying several nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR)-like genes. We named this novel gene as Rps12, which is expected to be an invaluable resource in breeding soybeans for Phytophthora resistance.\n","196":"\nArchitectural proteins play key roles in genome construction and regulate the expression of many genes, albeit the modulation of genome plasticity by these proteins is largely unknown. A critical screening of the architectural proteins in five crop species, viz., Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor, Cicer arietinum, and Vitis vinifera, and in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana along with evolutionary relevant species such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Physcomitrella patens, and Amborella trichopoda, revealed 9, 20, 10, 7, 7, 6, 1, 4, and 4 Alba (acetylation lowers binding affinity) genes, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of the genes and of their counterparts in other plant species indicated evolutionary conservation and diversification. In each group, the structural components of the genes and motifs showed significant conservation. The chromosomal location of the Alba genes of rice (OsAlba), showed an unequal distribution on 8 of its 12 chromosomes. The expression profiles of the OsAlba genes indicated a distinct tissue-specific expression in the seedling, vegetative, and reproductive stages. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the OsAlba genes confirmed their stress-inducible expression under multivariate environmental conditions and phytohormone treatments. The evaluation of the regulatory elements in 68 Alba genes from the 9 species studied led to the identification of conserved motifs and overlapping microRNA (miRNA) target sites, suggesting the conservation of their function in related proteins and a divergence in their biological roles across species. The 3D structure and the prediction of putative ligands and their binding sites for OsAlba proteins offered a key insight into the structure-function relationship. These results provide a comprehensive overview of the subtle genetic diversification of the OsAlba genes, which will help in elucidating their functional role in plants.\n","197":"\nThe therapeutic management of obesity is challenging, hence further elucidating the underlying mechanisms of obesity development and identifying new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets are urgent and necessary. Here, we performed differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify significant genes and specific modules related to BMI based on gene expression profile data of 7 discordant monozygotic twins.\nIn the differential gene expression analysis, it appeared that 32 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were with a trend of up-regulation in twins with higher BMI when compared to their siblings. Categories of positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process, positive regulation of NF-kappa B import into nucleus, and peroxidase activity were significantly enriched within GO database and NF-kappa B signaling pathway within KEGG database. DEGs of NAMPT, TLR9, PTGS2, HBD, and PCSK1N might be associated with obesity. In the WGCNA, among the total 20 distinct co-expression modules identified, coral1 module (68 genes) had the strongest positive correlation with BMI (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04) and disease status (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04). Categories of positive regulation of phospholipase activity, high-density lipoprotein particle clearance, chylomicron remnant clearance, reverse cholesterol transport, intermediate-density lipoprotein particle, chylomicron, low-density lipoprotein particle, very-low-density lipoprotein particle, voltage-gated potassium channel complex, cholesterol transporter activity, and neuropeptide hormone activity were significantly enriched within GO database for this module. And alcoholism and cell adhesion molecules pathways were significantly enriched within KEGG database. Several hub genes, such as GAL, ASB9, NPPB, TBX2, IL17C, APOE, ABCG4, and APOC2 were also identified. The module eigengene of saddlebrown module (212 genes) was also significantly correlated with BMI (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04), and hub genes of KCNN1 and AQP10 were differentially expressed.\nWe identified significant genes and specific modules potentially related to BMI based on the gene expression profile data of monozygotic twins.

The use of gene sets in the analyses of high-throughput gene expression data has been intensively studied and applied in clinical research. However, the main interest remains in finding modules of biological knowledge, or corresponding gene sets, significantly associated with disease conditions. Risk prediction from censored survival times using gene sets hasn't been well studied. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that uses both single gene and gene set information together to predict patient survival risks from gene expression profiles. In the proposed method, gene sets provide context-level information that is poorly reflected by single genes. Complementarily, single genes help to supplement incomplete information of gene sets due to our imperfect biomedical knowledge. Through the tests over multiple data sets of cancer and trauma injury, the proposed method showed robust and improved performance compared with the conventional approaches with only single genes or gene sets solely. Additionally, we examined the prediction result in the trauma injury data, and showed that the modules of biological knowledge used in the prediction by the proposed method were highly interpretable in biology. A wide range of survival prediction problems in clinical genomics is expected to benefit from the use of biological knowledge. \n","199":"\nGene set analysis aims to identify differentially expressed or co-expressed genes within a biological pathway between two experimental conditions, so that it can eventually reveal biological processes and pathways involved in disease development. In the last few decades, various statistical and computational methods have been proposed to improve statistical power of gene set analysis. In recent years, much attention has been paid to differentially co-expressed genes since they can be potentially disease-related genes without significant difference in average expression levels between two conditions. In this paper, we propose a new statistical method to identify differentially co-expressed genes from microarray gene expression data. The proposed method first estimates co-expression levels of paired genes using covariance regularization by thresholding, and then significance of difference in covariance estimation between two conditions is evaluated. We demonstrated that the proposed method is more powerful than the existing main-stream methods to detect co-expressed genes through extensive simulation studies. Also, we applied it to various microarray gene expression datasets related with mutant p53 transcriptional activity, and epithelium and stroma breast cancer.\n","200":"\nThe frequency by which genes are studied correlates with the prior knowledge accumulated about them.

The latest meta-analysis of ASD GWAS (genome-wide association studies) has revealed the association of several SNPs that were replicated in additional sets of independent samples. However, summary statistics from GWAS can be used to perform a gene-based analysis (GBA). GBA allows to combine all genetic information across the gene to create a single statistic (p-value for each gene). Thus, PASCAL (Pathway scoring algorithm), a novel GBA tool, has been applied to the summary statistics from the latest meta-analysis of ASD. GBA approach (testing the gene as a unit) provides an advantage to perform an accurate insight into the biological ASD mechanisms. Therefore, a gene-network analysis and an enrichment analysis for KEGG and GO terms were carried out. GENE2FUNC was used to create gene expression heatmaps and to carry out differential expression analysis (DEA) across GTEx v7 tissues and Brainspan data. dbMDEGA was employed to perform a DEG analysis between ASD and brain control samples for the associated genes and interactors. Results: PASCAL has identified the following loci associated with ASD: XRN2, NKX2-4, PLK1S1, KCNN2, NKX2-2, CRHR1-IT1, C8orf74 and LOC644172. While some of these genes were previously reported by MAGMA (XRN2, PLK1S1, and KCNN2), PASCAL has been useful to highlight additional genes. The biological characterization of the ASD-associated genes and their interactors have demonstrated the association of several GO and KEGG terms. Moreover, DEA analysis has revealed several up- and down-regulated clusters. In addition, many of the ASD-associated genes and their interactors have shown association with ASD expression datasets. Conclusions: This study identifies several associations at a gene level in ASD. Most of them were previously reported by MAGMA. This fact proves that PASCAL is an efficient GBA tool to extract additional information from previous GWAS. In addition, this study has characterized for the first time the biological role of the ASD-associated genes across brain regions, neurodevelopmental stages, and ASD gene-expression datasets.\n","202":"\nAgave species are important crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants and widely cultivated in tropical areas for producing tequila spirit and fiber.

Consensus clustering was applied to discover the gene clusters in the expression data of GSE94349 and functional enrichment analysis was performed on gene set in each cluster. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes, and hubs were selected. Support vector machine (SVM) model was built based on the signature genes identified from enrichment analysis and PPI network. Dataset GSE94349 was used for training and testing, and GSE68015 was used for validation. Besides, RT-qPCR analysis was performed to analyze the expression of signature genes in ACP samples compared with normal controls. Seven gene clusters were discovered in the differentially expressed genes identified from GSE94349 dataset. Enrichment analysis of each cluster identified 25 pathways that highly associated with ACP. PPI network was built and 46 hubs were determined. Twenty-five pathway-related genes that overlapped with the hubs in PPI network were used as signatures to establish the SVM diagnosis model for ACP. The prediction accuracy of SVM model for training, testing, and validation data were 94, 85, and 74%, respectively. The expression of CDH1, CCL2, ITGA2, COL8A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 were significantly upregulated in ACP tumor samples, while CAMK2A, RIMS1, NEFL, SYT1, and STX1A were significantly downregulated, which were consistent with the differentially expressed gene analysis.

For most BnaGH3 genes, the exon-intron compositions were similar to diploid ancestors, while the cis-element distributions were obviously different from its ancestors. After allopolyploidization, the expression patterns of GH3 genes from ancestor species changed greatly in B. napus, and the orthologous gene pairs between An\/Ar and Cn\/Co had diverged expression patterns across four tissues. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the GH3 gene family in B. napus, and these results could contribute to identifying genes with vital roles in phytohormone-related growth and developmental processes.\n","211":"\nGene duplications and gene losses have been frequent events in the evolution of animal genomes, with the balance between these two dynamic processes contributing to major differences in gene number between species. After gene duplication, it is common for both daughter genes to accumulate sequence change at approximately equal rates. In some cases, however, the accumulation of sequence change is highly uneven with one copy radically diverging from its paralogue. Such 'asymmetric evolution' seems commoner after tandem gene duplication than after whole-genome duplication, and can generate substantially novel genes. We describe examples of asymmetric evolution in duplicated homeobox genes of moths, molluscs and mammals, in each case generating new homeobox genes that were recruited to novel developmental roles. The prevalence of asymmetric divergence of gene duplicates has been underappreciated, in part, because the origin of highly divergent genes can be difficult to resolve using standard phylogenetic methods.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evo-devo in the genomics era, and the origins of morphological diversity'.\n\u00a9 2016 The Author(s).\n","212":"\nHistone acts as the core for nucleosomes and is a key protein component of chromatin. Among different histone variants, histone H3 (HH3) variants have been reported to play vital roles in plant development. However, biological information and evolutionary relationships of HH3 genes in cotton remain to be elucidated. The current study identified 34 HH3 genes in Gossypium hirsutum. Phylogenetic analysis classified HH3 genes of 19 plant species into eight distinct clades. Sequence logos analysis among Arabidopsis, rice, and G. hirsutum amino acid residues showed higher conservation in amino acids. Using collinearity analysis, we identified 81 orthologous\/paralogous gene pairs among the four genomes (A, D, At, and Dt) of cotton. Further, orthologous\/paralogous and the Ka\/Ks ratio demonstrated that cotton HH3 genes experienced strong purifying selection pressure with restricted functional divergence resulting from segmental and whole genome duplication. Expression pattern analysis indicated that GhHH3 genes were preferentially expressed in cotton ovule tissues. Additionally, GhHH3 gene expression can be regulated by abiotic stresses (cold, heat, sodium chloride (NaCl), and polyethylene glycol (PEG)) and phytohormonal (brassinolide (BL), gibberellic acid (GA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)) treatments, suggesting that GhHH3 genes might play roles in abiotic and hormone stress resistance. Taken together, this work provides important information to decipher complete molecular and physiological functions of HH3 genes in cotton.\n","213":"\nThe domain of unknown function (DUF) superfamily encodes proteins of unknown functions in plants. Among them, DUF668 family members in plants possess a 29 amino-acid conserved domain, and this family has not been described previously. Here, we report this plant-specific novel DUF668 gene family containing 12 OsDUF668 genes in rice (Oryza sativa) and 91 DUF668s for the other seven plant species. In our study, DUF668 genes were present in both dicot and monocot plants, indicating that DUF668 is a conserved gene family that originated by predating the dicot-monocot divergence. Based on the gene structure and motif composition, the DUF668 family consists of two distinct clades, I and II in the phylogenetic tree. Remarkably, OsDUF668 genes clustered on the chromosomes merely show close phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that gene duplications or collinearity seldom happened. Cis-elements prediction display that over 80% of DUF668s contain phytohormone and light responsiveness factors. Further comprehensive experimental analyses of the OsDUF668 family are implemented in 22 different tissues, five hormone treatments, seven environmental factor stresses, and two pathogen-defense related stresses. The OsDUF668 genes express ubiquitously in analyzed rice tissues, and seven genes show tissue-specific high expression profiles. All OsDUF668s respond to drought, and some of Avr9\/Cf-9 rapidly elicited genes resist to salt, wound, and rice blast with rapidly altered expression patterns. These findings imply that OsDUF668 is essential for drought-enduring and plant defense. Together, our results bring the important role of the DUF668 gene family in rice development and fitness to the fore.\n","214":"\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of dual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reporter genes, including ferritin heavy subunit (Fth) and transferrin receptor (TfR), which provide sufficient MRI contrast for in vivo MRI tracking, and the Deltex-1 (DTX1) gene, which promotes human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) differentiation to smooth muscle cells (SMCs), to treat closed penile fracture (CPF).\nMulti-gene co-expressing hMSCs were generated. The expression of mRNA and proteins was assessed, and the original biological properties of hMSCs were determined and compared. The intracellular uptake of iron was evaluated, and the ability to differentiate into SMCs was detected. Fifty rabbits with CPF were randomly transplanted with PBS, hMSCs, Fth-TfR-hMSCs, DTX1-hMSCs, and Fth-TfR-DTX1-hMSCs. In vivo MRI was performed to detect the distribution and migration of the grafted cells and healing progress of CPF, and the results were correlated with histology.\nThe mRNA and proteins of the multi-gene were highly expressed. The transgenes could not influence the original biological properties of hMSCs. The dual MRI reporter genes increased the iron accumulation capacity, and the DTX1 gene promoted hMSC differentiation into SMCs. The distribution and migration of the dual MRI reporter gene-modified hMSCs, and the healing state of CPF could be obviously detected by MRI and confirmed by histology.\nThe dual MRI reporter genes could provide sufficient MRI contrast, and the distribution and migration of MSCs could be detected in vivo. The DTX1 gene can promote MSC differentiation into SMCs for the treatment of CPF and effectively inhibit granulation tissue formation.\n","215":"\nCompared with mammals, the bird Ig genetic system relies on gene conversion to create an Ab repertoire, with inversion of the IgA-encoding gene and very few cases of Ig subclass diversification. Although gene conversion has been studied intensively, class-switch recombination, a mechanism by which the IgH C region is exchanged, has rarely been investigated in birds. In this study, based on the published genome of pigeon (Columba livia) and high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of immune-related tissues, we identified a transcriptionally forward \u03b1 gene and found that the pigeon IgH gene locus is arranged as \u03bc-\u03b1-\u03c51-\u03c52. In this article, we show that both DNA deletion and inversion may result from IgA and IgY class switching, and similar junction patterns were observed for both types of class-switch recombination. We also identified two subclasses of \u03c5 genes in pigeon, which share low sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that divergence of the two pigeon \u03c5 genes occurred during the early stage of bird evolution. The data obtained in this study provide new insight into class-switch recombination and Ig gene evolution in birds.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.\n","216":"\nFor reliable results, Reverse Transcription Quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses depend on stably expressed reference genes for data normalization purposes. Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium that has become a serious threat worldwide. Unfortunately, there is no consensus for an ideal reference gene for RT-qPCR data normalization on K. pneumoniae. In this study, the expression profile of eleven candidate reference genes was assessed in K. pneumoniae cells submitted to various experimental conditions, and the expression stability of these candidate genes was evaluated using statistical algorithms BestKeeper, NormFinder, geNorm, Delta CT and RefFinder. The statistical analyses ranked recA, rho, proC and rpoD as the most suitable reference genes for accurate RT-qPCR data normalization in K. pneumoniae. The reliability of the proposed reference genes was validated by normalizing the relative expression of iron-regulated genes in K. pneumoniae cells submitted to iron-replete and iron-limited conditions.

There is limited evidence to support selection of the commonly used reference genes in rat ischaemic and toxicological kidney models. Employing these models, we determined the most stable reference genes by comparing 4 standard methods (NormFinder, qBase+, BestKeeper and comparative \u0394Cq) and developed a new 3-way linear mixed-effects model for evaluation of reference gene stability. This new technique utilises the intra-class correlation coefficient as the stability measure for multiple continuous and categorical covariates when determining the optimum normalisation factor. The model also determines confidence intervals for each candidate normalisation gene to facilitate selection and allow sample size calculation for designing experiments to identify reference genes. Of the 10 candidate reference genes tested, the geometric mean of polyadenylate-binding nuclear protein 1 (PABPN1) and beta-actin (ACTB) was the most stable reference combination. In contrast, commonly used ribosomal 18S and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were the most unstable. We compared the use of PABPN1\u00d7ACTB and 2 commonly used genes 18S and GAPDH on the expression of 4 genes of interest know to vary after renal injury and expressed by different kidney cell types (KIM-1, HIF1\u03b1, TGF\u03b21 and PECAM1). The less stable reference genes gave varying patterns of GOI expression in contrast to the use of the least unstable reference PABPN1\u00d7ACTB combination; this improved detection of differences in gene expression between experimental groups. Reduced within-group variation of the now more accurately normalised GOI may allow for reduced experimental group size particularly for comparison between various models. This objective selection of stable reference genes increased the reliability of comparisons within and between experimental groups.\n","219":"\nBackground: The development of heart failure (HF) remains a common complication following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is associated with substantial adverse outcomes. However, the specific predictive biomarkers and candidate therapeutic targets for post-infarction HF have not been fully established. We sought to perform a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify key modules, hub genes, and possible regulatory targets involved in the development of HF following AMI. Methods: Genes exhibiting the most (top 50%) variation in expression levels across samples in a GSE59867 dataset were imported to the WGCNA. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed on genes identified in the key module by Metascape. Gene regulatory networks were constructed using the microarray probe reannotation and bioinformatics database. Hub genes were screened out from the key module and validated using other datasets. Results: A total of 10,265 most varied genes and six modules were identified between AMI patients who developed HF within 6 months of follow-up and those who did not. Specifically, the blue module was found to be the most significantly related to the development of post-infarction HF. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the blue module was primarily associated with the inflammatory response, immune system, and apoptosis. Seven transcriptional factors, including SPI1, ZBTB7A, IRF8, PPARG, P65, KLF4, and Fos, were identified as potential regulators of the expression of genes identified in the blue module. Further, non-coding RNAs, including miR-142-3p and LINC00537, were identified as having close interactions with genes from the blue module. A total of six hub genes (BCL3, HCK, PPIF, S100A9, SERPINA1, and TBC1D9B) were identified and validated for their predictive value in identifying future HFs. Conclusions: By using the WGCNA, we provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanism and molecular markers correlated with HF development following an AMI, which may serve to improve risk stratification, therapeutic decisions, and prognosis prediction in AMI patients.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Niu, Zhang, Zhang, Hou, Pu, Chu, Bai and Zhang.\n","220":"\nThis study aimed to identify rheumatoid arthritis (RA) related genes based on microarray data using the WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) method.\nTwo gene expression profile datasets GSE55235 (10 RA samples and 10 healthy controls) and GSE77298 (16 RA samples and seven healthy controls) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Characteristic genes were identified using metaDE package.

MATERIAL AND METHODS GEO software and the GEO2R calculation method were used to analyze two mRNA profiles, including GSE 39548 and GSE 108195. The co-expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and searched in the DAVID and STRING databases for pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Cytoscape was used to draw the PPI network. DEGs were also analyzed using the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) algorithm. Cytoscape and cytoHubba were used to analyze the hub genes and visualize the molecular interaction networks. Rats (n=20) included the IRI model group (n=10) and a control group (n=10). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure and compare the expression of the identified genes in rat renal tissue in the IRI model and the control group. RESULTS Ten hub genes were identified, STAT3, CD44, ITGAM, CCL2, TIMP1, MYC, THBS1, IGF1, SOCS3, and CD14. Apart from IGF1, qRT-PCR showed that expression of these genes was significantly increased in renal tissue in the rat model of IRI. The HIF-1alpha signaling pathway was involved in IRI in the rat model, which was supported by MCODE analysis. CONCLUSIONS In a rat model of renal IRI, bioinformatics analysis of the GEO dataset and integration of gene expression profiles identified involvement of HIF-1alpha signaling and the STAT3 hub gene.\n","222":"\nThe adaptive evolution of animals to high-elevation environments has been extensively studied in vertebrates, while few studies have focused on insects. Gynaephora species (Lepidoptera: Lymantriinae) are endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and represent an important insect pest of alpine meadows. Here, we present a detailed comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of two Gynaephora species inhabiting different high-elevation environments: G. alpherakii and G. menyuanensis. The results indicated that the general mitogenomic features (genome size, nucleotide composition, codon usage and secondary structures of tRNAs) were well conserved between the two species. All of mitochondrial protein-coding genes were evolving under purifying selection, suggesting that selection constraints may play a role in ensuring adequate energy production. However, a number of substitutions and indels were identified that altered the protein conformations of ATP8 and NAD1, which may be the result of adaptive evolution of the two Gynaephora species to different high-elevation environments. Levels of gene expression for nine mitochondrial genes in nine different developmental stages were significantly suppressed in G. alpherakii, which lives at the higher elevation (~4800m above sea level), suggesting that gene expression patterns could be modulated by atmospheric oxygen content and environmental temperature. These results enhance our understanding of the genetic bases for the adaptive evolution of insects endemic to the QTP.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Two NBS-LRR candidate genes were identified and two diagnostic markers of RpsHC18 were developed. Phytophthora root rot caused by Phytophthora sojae is a destructive disease of soybean. The most effective disease-control strategy is to deploy resistant cultivars carrying Phytophthora-resistant Rps genes. The soybean cultivar Huachun 18 has a broad and distinct resistance spectrum to 12 P. sojae isolates. Quantitative trait loci sequencing (QTL-seq), based on the whole-genome resequencing (WGRS) of two extreme resistant and susceptible phenotype bulks from an F2:3 population, was performed, and one 767-kb genomic region with \u0394SNP-index\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.9 on chromosome 3 was identified as the RpsHC18 candidate region in Huachun 18. The candidate region was reduced to a 146-kb region by fine mapping. Nonsynonymous SNP and haplotype analyses were carried out in the 146-kb region among ten soybean genotypes using WGRS. Four specific nonsynonymous SNPs were identified in two nucleotide-binding sites-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes, RpsHC18-NBL1 and RpsHC18-NBL2, which were considered to be the candidate genes. Finally, one specific SNP marker in each candidate gene was successfully developed using a tetra-primer ARMS-PCR assay, and the two markers were verified to be specific for RpsHC18 and to effectively distinguish other known Rps genes. In this study, we applied an integrated genomic-based strategy combining WGRS with traditional genetic mapping to identify RpsHC18 candidate genes and develop diagnostic markers. These results suggest that next-generation sequencing is a precise, rapid and cost-effective way to identify candidate genes and develop diagnostic markers, and it can accelerate Rps gene cloning and marker-assisted selection for breeding of P. sojae-resistant soybean cultivars.\n","224":"\nPigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) is an important grain legume of the semi-arid tropics, mainly used for its protein rich seeds. To link the genome sequence information with agronomic traits resulting from specific developmental processes, a Cajanus cajan gene expression atlas (CcGEA) was developed using the Asha genotype. Thirty tissues\/organs representing developmental stages from germination to senescence were used to generate 590.84 million paired-end RNA-Seq data. The CcGEA revealed a compendium of 28 793 genes with differential, specific, spatio-temporal and constitutive expression during various stages of development in different tissues. As an example to demonstrate the application of the CcGEA, a network of 28 flower-related genes analysed for cis-regulatory elements and splicing variants has been identified. In addition, expression analysis of these candidate genes in male sterile and male fertile genotypes suggested their critical role in normal pollen development leading to seed formation. Gene network analysis also identified two regulatory genes, a pollen-specific SF3 and a sucrose-proton symporter, that could have implications for improvement of agronomic traits such as seed production and yield. In conclusion, the CcGEA provides a valuable resource for pigeonpea to identify candidate genes involved in specific developmental processes and to understand the well-orchestrated growth and developmental process in this resilient crop.\n\u00a9 The Author 2017.

MJD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the coding region of the ATXN3 gene. Previous findings indicate the potential of transcriptional alterations in blood of MJD patients as biomarkers of disease. Accurate quantification of gene expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) depends on data normalization, usually performed using reference genes. Because the expression level of routinely used housekeeping genes may vary in multiple biological and experimental conditions, reference gene controls should be validated in each specific experimental design. Here, we aimed to evaluate the expression behavior of five housekeeping genes previously reported as stably expressed in peripheral blood of patients from several disorders-peptidylprolyl isomerase B (PPIB), TNF receptor associated protein 1 (TRAP1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 1 (DECR1), and folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). Expression levels of these five genes were assessed by qPCR in blood from MJD subjects (preataxic and patients) and matched controls. While all housekeeping genes, here studied, were stably expressed in our sets of samples, TRAP1 showed to be the most stable gene by NormFinder and BestKeeper. We, therefore, conclude that any of these genes could be used as reference gene in future qPCR studies using blood samples from MJD subjects.\n","226":"\nHypertension and bronchial asthma are a major issue for people's health. As of 2014, approximately one billion adults, or ~\u200922% of the world population, have had hypertension. As of 2011, 235-330 million people globally have been affected by asthma and approximately 250,000-345,000 people have died each year from the disease. The development of the effective treatment therapies against these diseases is complicated by their comorbidity features. This is often a major problem in diagnosis and their treatment. Hence, in this study the bioinformatical methodology for the analysis of the comorbidity of these two diseases have been developed. As such, the search for candidate genes related to the comorbid conditions of asthma and hypertension can help in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the comorbid condition of these two diseases, and can also be useful for genotyping and identifying new drug targets.\nUsing ANDSystem, the reconstruction and analysis of gene networks associated with asthma and hypertension was carried out. The gene network of asthma included 755 genes\/proteins and 62,603 interactions, while the gene network of hypertension - 713 genes\/proteins and 45,479 interactions. Two hundred and five genes\/proteins and 9638 interactions were shared between asthma and hypertension. An approach for ranking genes implicated in the comorbid condition of two diseases was proposed. The approach is based on nine criteria for ranking genes by their importance, including standard methods of gene prioritization (Endeavor, ToppGene) as well as original criteria that take into account the characteristics of an associative gene network and the presence of known polymorphisms in the analysed genes. According to the proposed approach, the genes IL10, TLR4, and CAT had the highest priority in the development of comorbidity of these two diseases. Additionally, it was revealed that the list of top genes is enriched with apoptotic genes and genes involved in biological processes related to the functioning of central nervous system.\nThe application of methods of reconstruction and analysis of gene networks is a productive tool for studying the molecular mechanisms of comorbid conditions. The method put forth to rank genes by their importance to the comorbid condition of asthma and hypertension was employed that resulted in prediction of 10 genes, playing the key role in the development of the comorbid condition.

However, insect-resistant germplasms for sugarcane are not available in any collections all over the world, and the molecular mechanism of insect resistance has not been elucidated. In this study, cry1Ac transgenic sugarcane lines were obtained and the biological characteristics and transgene dosage effect were investigated and a global exploration of gene expression by transcriptome analysis was performed.\nThe transgene copies of foreign cry1Ac were variable and random. The correlation between the cry1Ac protein and cry1Ac gene copies differed between the transgenic lines from FN15 and ROC22. The medium copy lines from FN15 showed a significant linear relationship, while ROC22 showed no definite dosage effect. The transgenic lines with medium copies of cry1Ac showed an elite phenotype. Transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing indicated that up\/down regulated differentially expressed genes were abundant among the cry1Ac sugarcane lines and the receptor variety. Foreign cry1Ac gene and endogenous borer stress-related genes may have a synergistic effect. Three lines, namely, A1, A5, and A6, were selected for their excellent stem borer resistance and phenotypic traits and are expected to be used directly as cultivars or crossing parents for sugarcane borer resistance breeding.\nCry1Ac gene integration dramatically improved sugarcane insect resistance. The elite transgenic offspring contained medium transgene copies.

Although many circadian gene identification algorithms have been developed, large numbers of false positives and low coverage are still major problems in this field. In this study we constructed a novel computational framework for circadian gene identification using deep neural networks (DNN) - a deep learning algorithm which can represent the raw form of data patterns without imposing assumptions on the expression distribution. Firstly, we transformed time-course gene expression data into categorical-state data to denote the changing trend of gene expression. Two distinct expression patterns emerged after clustering of the state data for circadian genes from our manually created learning dataset. DNN was then applied to discriminate the aperiodic genes and the two subtypes of periodic genes. In order to assess the performance of DNN, four commonly used machine learning methods including k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, na\u00efve Bayes, and support vector machines were used for comparison. The results show that the DNN model achieves the best balanced precision and recall. Next, we conducted large scale circadian gene detection using the trained DNN model for the remaining transcription profiles. Comparing with JTK_CYCLE and a study performed by M\u00f6ller-Levet et al. (doi: https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1217154110), we identified 1132 novel periodic genes.

For an intensive investigation of the seasonal and labor-dependent expression patterns of its genes, accurate quantification of the target gene transcription level is a fundamental step. To date, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has been widely used for rapid quantification of gene transcripts, with reliable reference gene(s) for normalization. To this end, in an attempt to search for reliable reference genes, the amplification efficiencies of six candidate reference genes (rp49, rpL32, rpS18, tbp, tub, and gapdh) were determined. Subsequently, four genes (rpL32, rpS18, tbp, and gapdh) with PCR efficiencies of 90% to 110% were evaluated for their expression stabilities with three programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) and used for normalization of seasonal expression patterns of target genes in the forager and nurse heads. Although the three programs revealed slightly different results, two genes, rpS18 and gapdh, were suggested to be the optimal reference genes for qRT-PCR-based determination of seasonal and labor-specific gene expression profiles. Furthermore, the combined use of these two genes yielded a more accurate normalization, compared with the use of a single gene in the head of honey bee. The validated reference genes can be widely used for quantification of target gene expression in honey bee head although it is still remained to be elucidated the expression levels of the selected reference genes in specific tissues in head.\n","230":"\nOxidative stress is the process by which reactive molecules and free radicals are formed in cells. In this study, we report the blood-based gene expression profile of oxidative stress and antioxidant genes for identifying surrogate markers of liver tissue in\u00a0chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients by using real-time PCR. A total of 144 untreated patients diagnosed with CHC having genotype 3a and 20 healthy controls were selected for the present study. Liver biopsy staging and grading of CHC patients were performed using the METAVIR score. Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue and blood samples, followed by cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR. The relative expression of genes was calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. The expression profile of 84 genes associated with oxidative stress and antioxidants was determined in liver tissue and blood samples. In liver tissue, 46 differentially expressed genes (upregulated, 27; downregulated, 19) were identified in CHC patients compared to normal samples. In blood, 61 genes (upregulated, 51; downregulated; 10) were significantly expressed in CHC patients. A comparison of gene expression in liver and whole blood showed that 20 genes were expressed in a similar manner in the liver and blood. The expression levels of commonly expressed liver and blood-based genes were also correlated with clinical factors in CHC patients. A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis of oxidative stress genes (ALB, CAT, DHCR24, GPX7, PRDX5, and MBL2) showed that infections in patients with CHC can be distinguished from healthy controls. In conclusion, blood-based gene expression can reflect the behavior of oxidative stress genes in liver tissue, and this blood-based gene expression study in CHC patients explores new blood-based non-invasive biomarkers that represent liver damage.\n","231":"\nMost organisms must cope with temperature changes. This involves genes and gene networks both as subjects and agents of cellular protection, creating difficulties in understanding. Here, we study how heating and cooling affect expression of single genes and synthetic gene circuits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae We discovered that nonoptimal temperatures induce a cell fate choice between stress resistance and growth arrest. This creates dramatic gene expression bimodality in isogenic cell populations, as arrest abolishes gene expression. Multiscale models incorporating population dynamics, temperature-dependent growth rates, and Arrhenius scaling of reaction rates captured the effects of cooling, but not those of heating in resistant cells. Molecular-dynamics simulations revealed how heating alters the conformational dynamics of the TetR repressor, fully explaining the experimental observations. Overall, nonoptimal temperatures induce a cell fate decision and corrupt gene and gene network function in computationally predictable ways, which may aid future applications of engineered microbes in nonstandard temperatures.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 the Author(s).

Vertebrates also respond to progesterone via membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs) or membrane associated progesterone receptors (MAPRs) through rapid nongenomic mechanisms. Lampreys are extant agnathan vertebrates, residing at the evolutionary juncture where vertebrates diverged from invertebrates. A survey of the progesterone receptor (PR) gene sequences in lamprey genomes would inform PR gene evolutionary events during the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates.\nIn this study, we annotated sequences of one nPR, four mPR (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03b5) and four MAPR genes from genomes of two lamprey species (Petromyzon marinus and Lethenteron japonicum). To infer the origin and evolutionary history of PR genes, we constructed phylogenetic trees of PR homologous sequences across representative species of metazoans. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the mPR\u03b3 gene first appeared in non-bilaterians, and the mPR\u03b2 gene likely arose from a duplication of mPR\u03b3. On the other hand, the mPR\u03b3 gene gave rise to the mPR\u03b4 and \u03b5 genes much later in the vertebrate lineage. In addition, the mPR\u03b1 gene first appeared in cartilaginous fishes, likely derived from duplication of mPR\u03b2 after the agnathan-gnathostome divergence. All known MAPR genes were present in the lamprey genomes. Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), neudesin and neuferricin genes probably evolved in parallel in non-bilaterians, whereas two copies of PGRMC genes probably derived from duplication of ancestral PGRMC1 sequence and appeared before the speciation of lampreys.\nNon-classical mPR and MAPR genes first evolved in non-bilaterians and classical nPR genes evolved later in basal vertebrates. Sequence repertoires for membrane progesterone receptor genes in vertebrates likely originated from an ancestral metazoan sequence and expanded via several duplication events.\n","233":"\nIdentifying disease genes from a vast amount of genetic data is one of the most challenging tasks in the post-genomic era. Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities.

We downloaded gene expression profile of mRNA and related clinical data of GSE70768 data set from public database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the relationships between gene modules and clinical features, as well as the candidate genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were developed to investigate the potential functions of related hub genes. Importantly, basic experiments were performed to verify the relationship between hub genes and the phenotype previously identified. Lastly, copy number variation (CNV) analysis was conducted to explore the genetical alteration. WGCNA identified that black module was the most relevant module which was tightly related to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) phenotype. KEGG and GO analysis results revealed genes in black module were mainly related to RNA splicing. Additionally, 9 genes were chosen as hub genes and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2\/B1 (HNRNPA2B1), golgin A8 family member B (GOLGA8B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 interacting protein 3 (MAPK8IP3) were identified to be associated with PCa progression and prognosis. Moreover, all above three genes were highly expressed in CRPC-like cells and their suppression led to hindered cell proliferation in vitro. Finally, CNV analysis found that amplification was the main type of alteration of the 3 hub genes. Our study found that HNRNPA2B1, GOLGA8B and MAPK8IP3 were identified to be tightly associated with tumour progression and prognosis, and further researches are needed before clinical application.\n\u00a9 2020 The Authors.

The widely used housekeeping genes may change their expression levels at different tissue under different treatment or stress conditions. Therefore, systematical evaluation on the housekeeping genes is required for gene expression analysis. Up to date, no work was performed to evaluate the housekeeping genes in cotton under stress treatment. In this study, we chose 10 housekeeping genes to systematically assess their expression levels at two different tissues (leaves and roots) under two different abiotic stresses (salt and drought) with three different concentrations. Our results show that there is no best reference gene for all tissues at all stress conditions. The reliable reference gene should be selected based on a specific condition. For example, under salt stress, UBQ7, GAPDH and EF1A8 are better reference genes in leaves; TUA10, UBQ7, CYP1, GAPDH and EF1A8 were better in roots. Under drought stress, UBQ7, EF1A8, TUA10, and GAPDH showed less variety of expression level in leaves and roots. Thus, it is better to identify reliable reference genes first before performing any gene expression analysis. However, using a combination of housekeeping genes as reference gene may provide a new strategy for normalization of gene expression. In this study, we found that combination of four housekeeping genes worked well as reference genes under all the stress conditions.\n\u00a9 2013.\n","236":"\nQuantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is frequently used as research tool in experimental oncology. There are some studies of valid endogenous control genes in the field of human glioma research, which, however, only focus on the comparison between normal brain with tumor tissue and malignant transformation toward secondary glioblastomas. Aim of this study was to validate a more general reference gene also suitable for pre- and posttreatment analysis and other evaluations (eg, primary vs secondary glioblastoma).\nThis quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to test a panel of the 6 most suitable reference genes from other studies representing different physiological pathways (ACTB, GAPDH, POLR2A, RPL13A, SDHA, and TBP) in all common glioma groups, namely: diffuse astrocytoma World Health Organization II, anaplastic astrocytoma World Health Organization III, secondary glioblastoma World Health Organization IV with and without chemotherapy, primary glioblastoma, recurrent glioblastoma, and gliomas before and after radiation. Expression stability was tested during the longitudinal course of the disease in 8 single patients.\nEvaluation of the expression levels of the 6 target genes showed that ACTB, GAPDH, and RPL13A show higher expression compared to SDHA, POLR2A, and TBP. ACTB, GAPDH, and RPL13A showed different expression levels between astrozytoma grade II and primary glioblastoma. Except for this difference, the candidate genes were not differentially expressed between primary and secondary glioblastomas and between the World Health Organization tumor grades. Furthermore, they remained stable before and after radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy. Therefore, they are adequate references for glioblastoma gene expression studies. The comparison of all tested genes resulted in SDHA and ACTB as most stable reference genes determined by the NormFinder software. Our data revealed lowest intragroup variation in the SDHA, highest in the RPL13A gene.\nAll tested genes may be recommended as universal reference genes for data normalization in gene expression studies under different treatment regimens both in primary glioblastomas and astrocytomas of different grades (World Health Organization grades II-IV), respectively. In summary, ACTB and SDHA exhibited the best stability values and showed the lowest intergroup expression variability.\n","237":"\nNetwork topology-based approaches prove to be highly efficient in addressing multifactorial phenomena such as acquired drug resistance in cancer. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes across multiple microarray datasets (meta-DEGs), to prioritize meta-DEGs to find the most promising genes linked to acquired taxane resistance (ATR), and to analyze the relevant biological networks using topology analysis. A total of 771 meta-DEGs were identified by performing a cross-platform meta-analysis of ATR-related microarray datasets. A gene prioritization method was used to simultaneously identify activated or deactivated genes on a co-expression map and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The top 10 prioritized genes in the gene co-expression and the top 1% highly ranked genes in the PPI network were identified. The selected meta-DEGs were used to construct biological networks, and topological analysis was performed using network centrality measures. Using integrative analyses, we identified ATR candidate genes, including several previously unidentified genes that were found to be associated with ATR. From the gene co-expression network, PRSS23 was the highest-ranking gene at local average connectivity measure and ADAM9 was ranked highest in other centralities. In protein interaction network, HSPA1A, ANXA1, and PA2G4 showed highest ranks in network centrality analyses. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the gene expression patterns associated with ATR. Furthermore, it presents a new approach to identification of unveiled candidate genes to ATR, using a gene prioritization method and network analysis.\n","238":"\nAntibiotic resistance is considered one of the most urgent threats to modern healthcare, and the role of the environment in resistance development is increasingly recognized. It is often assumed that the abundance and diversity of known resistance genes are representative also for the non-characterized fraction of the resistome in a given environment, but this assumption has not been verified. In this study, this hypothesis is tested, using the resistance gene profiles of 1109 metagenomes from various environments.\nThis study shows that the diversity and abundance of known antibiotic resistance genes can generally predict the diversity and abundance of undescribed resistance genes. However, the extent of this predictability is dependent on the type of environment investigated. Furthermore, it is shown that carefully selected small sets of resistance genes can describe total resistance gene diversity remarkably well.\nThe results of this study suggest that knowledge gained from large-scale quantifications of known resistance genes can be utilized as a proxy for unknown resistance factors. This is important for current and proposed monitoring efforts for environmental antibiotic resistance and has implications for the design of risk ranking strategies and the choices of measures and methods for describing resistance gene abundance and diversity in the environment.\n","239":"\nBlack pepper (Piper nigrum) is a vital spice crop with uses ranging from culinary to pharmacological applications. However, limited genetic information has constrained the understanding of the molecular regulation of flower and fruit development in black pepper. In this study, a comparison among three different black pepper varieties, Semengok Aman (SA), Kuching (KC), and Semengok 1 (S1), with varying fruit characteristics was used to provide insight on the genetic regulation of flower and fruit development. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to determine the flower and fruit transcriptomes by sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform followed by de novo assembly using SOAPdenovo-Trans. The high-quality assembly of 66,906 of unigenes included 64.4% of gene sequences (43,115) with similarity to one or more protein sequences from the GenBank database. Annotation with Blast2Go assigned 37,377 genes to one or more Gene Ontology terms. Of these genes, 5,874 genes were further associated with the biological pathways recorded in the KEGG database. Comparison of flower and fruit transcriptome data from the three different black pepper varieties revealed a large number of DEGs between flower and fruit of the SA variety. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis further supports functions of DEGs between flower and fruit in the categories of carbohydrate metabolic processes, embryo development, and DNA metabolic processes while the DEGs in fruit relate to biosynthetic process, secondary metabolic process, and catabolic process. The enrichment of DEGs in KEGG pathways was also investigated, and a large number of genes were found to belong to the nucleotide metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism categories. Gene expression profiling of flower formation-related genes reveals that other than regulating the flowering in black pepper, the flowering genes might also be implicated in the fruit development process. Transcriptional analysis of sugar transporter and carbohydrate metabolism genes in different fruit varieties suggested that the carbohydrate metabolism in black pepper fruit is developmentally regulated, and some genes might serve as potential genes for future crop quality improvement. Study on the piperine-related gene expression analysis suggested that lysine-derived products might present in all stages of fruit development, but the transportation was only active at the early stage of fruit development. These results indicate several candidate genes related to the development of flower and fruit in black pepper and provide a resource for future functional analysis and potentially for future crop improvement.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Choy Yuen Khew et al.\n","240":"\nHuman lifespan is determined by genetic and environmental factors. Potential longevity genes are neither specific nor reproducible, and longevity-related genes are constantly confused with age-related genes. To distinguish specific age- and longevity-related genes, we analyzed a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset established by the Leiden Longevity Study. The individuals were classified into longevity (mean age, 93.4 \u00b1 3.0 years), longevity offspring (60.8 \u00b1 6.1) and control (61.9 \u00b1 6.9) groups. The series matrix files were downloaded, and average expression values were calculated. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between longevity and control groups and those between longevity and their offspring were identified by GEO2R online. A total of 507 longevity- and 755 age-related DEGs were visualized using a Venn diagram. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed on the longevity- and age-related DEGs. Age-related color modules and genes were identified. However, no longevity-related modules or genes were found. The green module, with 46 age-related DEGs, was the most biologically significant to age and aging. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein interaction pathway analyses were conducted on these 46 DEGs, which are mainly enriched in B cell activation and receptor signaling pathways. CR2, VPREB3, MS4A1 and CCR6 were considered the most crucial candidate genes for aging.\n","241":"\nIncreasing evidence suggests that adaptation to diverse environments often involves selection on existing variation rather than new mutations. A previous study identified a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 2 of two paralogous \u03b2-globin genes of the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) in Britain in which the ancestral serine (Ser) and the derived cysteine (Cys) allele represent geographically partitioned functional variation affecting the erythrocyte antioxidative capacity. Here we studied the geographical pattern of the two-locus Ser\/Cys polymorphism throughout Europe and tested for the geographic correlation between environmental variables and allele frequency, expected if the polymorphism was under spatially heterogeneous environment-related selection. Although bank vole population history clearly is important in shaping the dispersal of the oxidative stress protective Cys allele, analyses correcting for population structure suggest the Europe-wide pattern is affected by geographical variation in environmental conditions. The \u03b2-globin phenotype is encoded by the major paralog HBB-T1 but we found evidence of bidirectional gene conversion of exon 2 with the low-expression paralog HBB-T2. Our data support the model where gene conversion reshuffling genotypes between high- and low- expressed paralogs enables tuning of erythrocyte thiol levels, which may help maintain intracellular redox balance under fluctuating environmental conditions. Therefore, our study suggests a possible role for gene conversion between differentially expressed gene duplicates as a mechanism of physiological adaptation of populations to new or changing environments.\n","242":"\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the interactions among messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in colorectal cancer (CRC), in order to examine its underlying mechanisms. The raw gene expression data was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. An online tool, GEO2R, which is based on the limma package, was used to identify differentially expressed genes. The co-expression between lncRNAs and mRNAs was identified utilizing the weighted gene co-expression analysis package of R to construct a coding non-coding (CNC) network. The function of the genes in the CNC network was determined by performing Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways enrichment analysis. The interactions among miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted using Lncbase and mirWalk to construct the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. The expression of the genes involved in the ceRNA network was further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. A total of 3,183 dysregulated mRNAs, 78 dysregulated miRNAs and 2,248 dysregulated lncRNAs were screened in two GEO datasets. Combined with the results of the dysregulated genes, 169 genes were selected to construct the CNC network. 'p53 signaling pathway' and the 'cell cycle' were the most significant enriched pathways in the genes involved in the CNC network. Finally, a validated ceRNA network composed of 2 lncRNAs (MIR22HG and RP11-61I13.3), 5 miRNAs (hsa-miR-765, hsa-miR-198, hsa-miR-125a-3p, hsa-miR-149-3p and hsa-miR-650) and 5 mRNAs (ANK2, BTK, GBP2, PCSK5 and PDK4) was obtained. In conclusion, MIR22HG may regulate PCSK5, BTK and PDK4, and RP11-61I13.3 may regulate the ANK2, GBP2, PCSK5 through sponging miRNAs to act on the progression of CRC, and the potential function of these genes have been revealed. However, the diagnostic and prognostic value of these genes requires further validation.\n","243":"\nThe increasing demand of strawberry (Fragaria\u00d7ananassa Duch) fruits is associated mainly with their sensorial characteristics and the content of antioxidant compounds. Nevertheless, the strawberry production has been hampered due to its sensitivity to abiotic stresses. Therefore, to understand the molecular mechanisms highlighting stress response is of great importance to enable genetic engineering approaches aiming to improve strawberry tolerance. However, the study of expression of genes in strawberry requires the use of suitable reference genes. In the present study, seven traditional and novel candidate reference genes were evaluated for transcript normalization in fruits of ten strawberry cultivars and two abiotic stresses, using RefFinder, which integrates the four major currently available software programs: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the comparative delta-Ct method. The results indicate that the expression stability is dependent on the experimental conditions. The candidate reference gene DBP (DNA binding protein) was considered the most suitable to normalize expression data in samples of strawberry cultivars and under drought stress condition, and the candidate reference gene HISTH4 (histone H4) was the most stable under osmotic stresses and salt stress. The traditional genes GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and 18S (18S ribosomal RNA) were considered the most unstable genes in all conditions. The expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED1) genes were used to further confirm the validated candidate reference genes, showing that the use of an inappropriate reference gene may induce erroneous results. This study is the first survey on the stability of reference genes in strawberry cultivars and osmotic stresses and provides guidelines to obtain more accurate RT-qPCR results for future breeding efforts. \nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Eleven candidate reference genes of M. hapla were selected to evaluate gene expression stability under different conditions. The stability of candidate reference genes was ranked using RefFinder analysis, and the optimal number of reference genes was recommended with geNorm. Notably, the most stable reference genes were SDHA, Mdh, and RpS6 for all samples; SDHA and RpS6 were particularly stable during development stage treatments, whereas Mdh and RpS6 were appropriate for temperature and inorganic compound treatments. In contrast, the least stable reference genes were Actin1 during development stages and all other treatments, GAPDH for temperature treatments, and \u03b1-Tub for inorganic compound treatments. One target gene, Mh-Hsp90, was used to verify the selection of reference genes, results showed Mdh and RpS6 could be used as suitable reference genes for M. hapla, and Mdh plus RpS6 were better.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to identify biological pathways that might be involved.\nWeighted gene co-expression network was constructed based on dataset GSE34105. The blue module and turquoise module most related to the progress of TSCC were identified by the network. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that 2 key modules were significantly enriched in apoptosis and immunity related biological processes and pathway. Network topology analysis, gene difference analysis and survival analysis were used to screen 9 hub genes (NOC2L, AIMP2, ANXA2, DIABLO, H2AFZ, MANBAL, PRDX6, SNX14, TIMM23). The expression of hub genes was significantly correlated with the prognosis of TSCC. GSEA showed that the high expression group of hub genes was mainly enriched in olfactory transduction, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and the low expression group was mainly enriched in base excision repair, cysteine and methionine metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation.\nTwo key modules and 9 hub genes screened by WGCNA were closely related to the occurrence and prognosis of TSCC.

Next, we screened hub genes related to the progression of CRC authenticated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine databases. Three hub genes (HCLS1, EVI2B, and CD48) were identified, and survival analysis was further performed. Moreover, the results of qPCR and immunohistochemistry staining revealed that HCLS1, EVI2B, and CD48 are tumor suppressor genes. Further, the functional study verified that over-expression of HCLS1, EVI2B, and CD48 can reduce the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of CRC cells and significantly suppress CRC tumor growth in vivo. In summary, we identified three hub genes that were associated with the progression of CRC that can be applied in treatment.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Yuan, Chen, Wang, Xu, Zhang, Sun and Liang.\n","247":"\nSesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is one of the world's most important oil crops. However, it is susceptible to abiotic stresses in general, and to waterlogging and drought stresses in particular. The molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance in sesame have not yet been elucidated. The WRKY domain transcription factors play significant roles in plant growth, development, and responses to stresses. However, little is known about the number, location, structure, molecular phylogenetics, and expression of the WRKY genes in sesame.\nWe performed a comprehensive study of the WRKY gene family in sesame and identified 71 SiWRKYs. In total, 65 of these genes were mapped to 15 linkage groups within the sesame genome. A phylogenetic analysis was performed using a related species (Arabidopsis thaliana) to investigate the evolution of the sesame WRKY genes. Tissue expression profiles of the WRKY genes demonstrated that six SiWRKY genes were highly expressed in all organs, suggesting that these genes may be important for plant growth and organ development in sesame. Analysis of the SiWRKY gene expression patterns revealed that 33 and 26 SiWRKYs respond strongly to waterlogging and drought stresses, respectively. Changes in the expression of 12 SiWRKY genes were observed at different times after the waterlogging and drought treatments had begun, demonstrating that sesame gene expression patterns vary in response to abiotic stresses.\nIn this study, we analyzed the WRKY family of transcription factors encoded by the sesame genome. Insight was gained into the classification, evolution, and function of the SiWRKY genes, revealing their putative roles in a variety of tissues.

Furthermore, if possible, uncovering the links between core functions or pathways with these essential genes will further help us obtain deep insight into the key roles of these genes. In this study, we investigated the essential and non-essential genes reported in a previous study and extracted gene ontology (GO) terms and biological pathways that are important for the determination of essential genes. Through the enrichment theory of GO and KEGG pathways, we encoded each essential\/non-essential gene into a vector in which each component represented the relationship between the gene and one GO term or KEGG pathway. To analyze these relationships, the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) was adopted. Then, the incremental feature selection (IFS) and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to extract important GO terms and KEGG pathways. A prediction model was built simultaneously using the extracted GO terms and KEGG pathways, which yielded nearly perfect performance, with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.951, for distinguishing essential and non-essential genes. To fully investigate the key factors influencing the fundamental roles of essential genes, the 21 most important GO terms and three KEGG pathways were analyzed in detail. In addition, several genes was provided in this study, which were predicted to be essential genes by our prediction model. We suggest that this study provides more functional and pathway information on the essential genes and provides a new way to investigate related problems.\n","249":"\nIn a conventional view of the prokaryotic genome organization, promoters precede operons and ribosome binding sites (RBSs) with Shine-Dalgarno consensus precede genes.

Importantly, we designed GeneMarkS-2 to identify several types of distinct sequence patterns (signals) involved in gene expression control, among them the patterns characteristic for leaderless transcription as well as noncanonical RBS patterns. To assess the accuracy of GeneMarkS-2, we used genes validated by COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) annotation, proteomics experiments, and N-terminal protein sequencing. We observed that GeneMarkS-2 performed better on average in all accuracy measures when compared with the current state-of-the-art gene prediction tools. Furthermore, the screening of \u223c5000 representative prokaryotic genomes made by GeneMarkS-2 predicted frequent leaderless transcription in both archaea and bacteria. We also observed that the RBS sites in some species with leadered transcription did not necessarily exhibit the Shine-Dalgarno consensus.

In this study, 18 TIR1\/AFB genes were identified and could be clustered into six groups. The genes are located in 11 of 18 chromosomes in the genome of B. juncea var. tumida, and similar gene structures are found for each of those genes. Several cis-elements related to plant response to phytohormones, biotic stresses, and abiotic stresses are found in the promoter of BjuTIR1\/AFB genes. The results of qPCR analysis show that most genes have differential patterns of expression among six tissues, with the expression levels of some of the genes repressed by salt stress treatment.

The robustness of 24 candidate reference genes was evaluated across 80 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanomas of different thickness, -\/+ ulceration, -\/+ reported cases of metastases and of different BRAF mutation status using quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of the same genes and their robustness as normalizers was furthermore evaluated across a number of melanoma cell lines. We show that housekeeping genes like GAPDH do not qualify as stand-alone normalizers of genes expression in melanoma. Instead, we have as the first identified a panel of robust reference genes for normalization of gene expression in melanoma tumors and cultured melanoma cells. We recommend using a geometric mean of the expression of CLTA, MRPL19 and ACTB for normalization of gene expression in melanomas and a geometric mean of the expression of CASC3 and RPS2 for normalization of gene expression in melanoma cell lines.

The three poplar genotypes differed in wood anatomy, lignin content and saccharification potential. Drought resulted in reduced cambial activity, decreased vessel and fiber lumina, and increased the saccharification potential. The saccharification potential was unrelated to lignin content as well as to most wood anatomical traits. RNA sequencing of the developing xylem revealed that 1.5% of the analyzed genes were differentially expressed in response to drought, while 67% differed among the genotypes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified modules of co-expressed genes correlated with saccharification potential. These modules were enriched in gene ontology terms related to cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis and modification and vesicle transport, but not to lignin biosynthesis. Among the most strongly saccharification-correlated genes, those with regulatory functions, especially kinases, were prominent. We further identified transcription factors whose transcript abundances differed among genotypes, and which were co-regulated with genes for biosynthesis and modifications of hemicelluloses and pectin. Overall, our study suggests that the regulation of pectin and hemicellulose metabolism is a promising target for improving wood quality of second generation bioenergy crops. The causal relationship of the identified genes and pathways with saccharification potential needs to be validated in further experiments.\n","254":"\nBACKGROUND Bladder cancer (BC) is the most common urological malignant tumor. In BC, aberrant DNA methylation is believed to be associated with carcinogenesis. Therefore, the identification of key genes and pathways could help determine the potential molecular mechanisms of BC development. MATERIAL AND METHODS Microarray data on gene expression and gene methylation were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Abnormal methylated\/expressed genes were analyzed by GEO2R and statistical software R. Gene Ontology term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed using the DAVID database and KOBAS 3.0. STRING and Cytoscape software were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and analyze modules of the PPI network. RESULTS A total of 71 hypomethylated\/upregulated genes were significantly enriched in cell-cell adhesion and blood vessel development. KEGG pathway analysis highlighted p53 signaling and metabolic pathways. Five core genes in the PPI network were determined: CDH1, DDOST, CASP8, DHX15, and PTPRF. Additionally, 89 hypermethylated\/downregulated genes were found. These genes were enriched mostly in cell adhesion and signal transduction. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment in focal adhesion. The top 5 core genes in the PPI network were GNG4, ADCY9, NPY, ADRA2B, and PENK. We found most of the core genes were also significantly altered in the Cancer Genome Atlas database. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal methylated\/expressed genes and key signaling pathways involved in BC were identified through integrated bioinformatics analysis. In the future, these genes may serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic targets in BC.\n","255":"\nBixa orellana L., popularly known as annatto, produces several secondary metabolites of pharmaceutical and industrial interest, including bixin, whose molecular basis of biosynthesis remain to be determined. Gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is an important tool to advance such knowledge. However, correct interpretation of qPCR data requires the use of suitable reference genes in order to reduce experimental variations. In the present study, we have selected four different candidates for reference genes in B. orellana, coding for 40S ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9), histone H4 (H4), 60S ribosomal protein L38 (RPL38) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18SrRNA). Their expression stabilities in different tissues (e.g. flower buds, flowers, leaves and seeds at different developmental stages) were analyzed using five statistical tools (NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, \u0394Ct method and RefFinder). The results indicated that RPL38 is the most stable gene in different tissues and stages of seed development and 18SrRNA is the most unstable among the analyzed genes. In order to validate the candidate reference genes, we have analyzed the relative expression of a target gene coding for carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (CCD1) using the stable RPL38 and the least stable gene, 18SrRNA, for normalization of the qPCR data. The results demonstrated significant differences in the interpretation of the CCD1 gene expression data, depending on the reference gene used, reinforcing the importance of the correct selection of reference genes for normalization.\n","256":"\nA consensus rust QTL was identified within a 1.25 cM map interval of A03 chromosome in cultivated peanut. This map interval contains a TIR-NB-LRR R gene and four pathogenesis-related genes. Disease resistance in plants is manifested due to the specific interaction between the R gene product and its cognate avirulence gene product (AVR) in the pathogen. Puccinia arachidis Speg. causes rust disease and inflicts economic damages to peanut. Till now, no experimental evidence is known for the action of R gene in peanut for rust resistance. A fine mapping approach towards the development of closely linked markers for rust resistance gene was undertaken in this study. Phenotyping of an RIL population at five environments for field rust score and subsequent QTL analysis has identified a 1.25\u00a0cM map interval that harbored a consensus major Rust_QTL in A03 chromosome. This Rust_QTL is flanked by two SSR markers: FRS72 and SSR_GO340445. Both the markers clearly identified strong association of the mapped region with rust reaction in both resistant and susceptible genotypes from a collection of 95 cultivated peanut germplasm. This 1.25\u00a0cM map interval contained 331.7\u00a0kb in the physical map of A. duranensis and had a TIR-NB-LRR category R gene (Aradu.Z87JB) and four glucan endo-1,3 \u03b2 glucosidase genes (Aradu.RKA6\u00a0M, Aradu.T44NR, Aradu.IWV86 and Aradu.VG51Q). Another resistance gene analog was also found in the vicinity of mapped Rust_QTL. The sequence between SSR markers, FRS72 and FRS49, contains an LRR-PK (Aradu.JG217) which is equivalent to RHG4 in soybean. Probably, the protein kinase domain in AhRHG4 acts as an integrated decoy for the cognate AVR from Puccinia arachidis and helps the TIR-NB-LRR R-protein to initiate a controlled program cell death in resistant peanut plants.\n","257":"\nPectate lyase catalyses the eliminative cleavage of de-esterified pectin, which is a major component of primary cell walls in many higher plants. Pectate lyase-like (PLL) genes have been identified in various plant species and are involved in a broad range of physiological processes associated with pectin degradation. Previous studies have functionally identified two PLL genes in rice (Oryza sativa. L). However, the knowledge concerning genome-wide analysis of this family remains limited, and functions of the other PLL genes have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, we identified 12 PLL genes based on a genome-wide investigation in rice. A complete overview of this gene family is presented, including chromosomal locations, exon-intron structure, cis-acting elements and conserved motifs. PLL protein sequences from multiple plant species were compared and divided into five groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that only a portion of OsPLL genes (4 of 12) exhibits detectable expression levels. Notably, OsPLL1, OsPLL3, OsPLL4 and OsPLL12 exhibit strong and preferential expression in panicles suggesting that the potential roles of these genes are crucial during rice panicle development. Moreover, knockdown of OsPLL3 and OsPLL4 by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) disrupted normal pollen development and resulted in partial male sterility. These results could provide valuable information for characterising the functions and dissecting the molecular mechanisms of the OsPLL genes.\n","258":"\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate critical genes in multiple sclerosis (MS) using microarray data from brain tissue in MS.\nThe expression profile data set of MS (GSE38010) downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database contained gene information from five plaque tissues from MS brains and two white matter tissues from healthy controls. An R package was applied to process these raw chip data. Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed to investigate interactions between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MS brain tissues.\nThis study identified a total of 1065 DEGs, including 530 up-regulated genes and 535 down-regulated genes, in MS brain tissue samples compared to those in normal white matter tissue samples. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the up-regulated DEGs were mainly related to neuron development, neuron projection morphogenesis and neuron differentiation. Furthermore, the down-regulated DEGs were largely related to axon ensheathment, ensheathment of neurons and nervous system development. Seven key genes were found as hub genes in the maintenance of the PPI network.\nSeveral key target genes and their GO and KEGG pathway enrichment identified in the present study may serve as feasible targets for MS therapies.\n","259":"\nRecent studies have focused on determining functional genes and microRNAs in the pest Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Most of these studies used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Suitable reference genes are necessary to normalize gene expression data of qRT-PCR. However, a comprehensive study on the reference genes in H. armigera remains lacking.\nTwelve candidate reference genes of H. armigera were selected and evaluated for their expression stability under different biotic and abiotic conditions. The comprehensive stability ranking of candidate reference genes was recommended by RefFinder and the optimal number of reference genes was calculated by geNorm. Two target genes, thioredoxin (TRX) and Cu\/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), were used to validate the selection of reference genes. Results showed that the most suitable candidate combinations of reference genes were as follows: 28S and RPS15 for developmental stages; RPS15 and RPL13 for larvae tissues; EF and RPL27 for adult tissues; GAPDH, RPL27, and \u03b2-TUB for nuclear polyhedrosis virus infection; RPS15 and RPL32 for insecticide treatment; RPS15 and RPL27 for temperature treatment; and RPL32, RPS15, and RPL27 for all samples.\nThis study not only establishes an accurate method for normalizing qRT-PCR data in H. armigera but also serve as a reference for further study on gene transcription in H. armigera and other insects.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The incidence of RCC has increased steadily in recent years. The pathogenesis of renal cell cancer remains poorly understood. Many of the tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and dysregulated pathways in ccRCC need to be revealed for improvement of the overall clinical outlook of the disease. Here, we developed a systems biology approach to prioritize the somatic mutated genes that lead to dysregulation of pathways in ccRCC. The method integrated multi-layer information to infer causative mutations and disease genes. First, we identified differential gene modules in ccRCC by coupling transcriptome and protein-protein interactions. Each of these modules consisted of interacting genes that were involved in similar biological processes and their combined expression alterations were significantly associated with disease type. Then, subsequent gene module-based eQTL analysis revealed somatic mutated genes that had driven the expression alterations of differential gene modules. Our study yielded a list of candidate disease genes, including several known ccRCC causative genes such as BAP1 and PBRM1, as well as novel genes such as NOD2, RRM1, CSRNP1, SLC4A2, TTLL1 and CNTN1. The differential gene modules and their driver genes revealed by our study provided a new perspective for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Moreover, we validated the results in independent ccRCC patient datasets. Our study provided a new method for prioritizing disease genes and pathways.\n","261":"\nBrinjal\/eggplant\/aubergine is one of the major solanaceous vegetable crops. Recent availability of genome information greatly facilitates the fundamental research on brinjal. Gene expression patterns during different stages of fruit development can provide clues towards the understanding of its biological functions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has become one of the most widely used methods for rapid and accurate quantification of gene expression. However, its success depends on the use of a suitable reference gene for data normalization. For qPCR analysis, a single reference gene is not universally suitable for all experiments. Therefore, reference gene validation is a crucial step. Suitable reference genes for qPCR analysis of brinjal fruit development have not been investigated so far. In this study, we have selected 21 candidate reference genes from the Brinjal (Solanum melongena) Plant Gene Indices database (compbio.dfci.harvard.edu\/tgi\/plant.html) and studied their expression profiles by qPCR during six different fruit developmental stages (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50\u00a0days post anthesis) along with leaf samples of the Pusa Purple Long (PPL) variety. To evaluate the stability of gene expression, geNorm and NormFinder analytical softwares were used. geNorm identified SAND (SAND family protein) and TBP (TATA binding protein) as the best pairs of reference genes in brinjal fruit development. The results showed that for brinjal fruit development, individual or a combination of reference genes should be selected for data normalization. NormFinder identified Expressed gene (expressed sequence) as the best single reference gene in brinjal fruit development. In this study, we have identified and validated for the first time reference genes to provide accurate transcript normalization and quantification at various fruit developmental stages of brinjal which can also be useful for gene expression studies in other Solanaceae plant species. \n","262":"\nChordoma is a rare tumor with a certain rate of distant metastasis. Skull base and sacrum are the two most common origin sites. This study tends to identify key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between classical clival and sacral chordomas, provide new targets for future treatment options of chordomas.\nThe gene expression profiles of GSE95084 and GSE68497 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database and were analyzed using the limma R package. Function and enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed based on DAVID Database. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Cytoscape based on the data collected from STRING online datasets. Hub genes selection and modules analyses of the PPI network were conducted by plugin cytoHubba and MCODE of Cytoscape software, respectively.\nIn total, 728 genes, including 363 up-regulated genes and 365 down-regulated genes were selected as DEGs. Notably, GO analysis showed that both up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in cell component such as an integral component of the membrane, plasma membrane and extracellular exosome. DEGs were mainly enriched in pathways like Pathways in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. FYN, ITGB3, ACTN2 and IGF1 were identified as hub genes and they were all involved in focal adhesion signaling pathway. Furthermore, five significant network modules were obtained from the PPI network.\nThis study helps to further understand the molecular characteristics of classic chordomas of two distinct sites. Hub genes FYN, ITGB3, ACTN2, and IGF1, as well as focal adhesion signaling pathway, would be new targets for future treatment options of chordomas.\n","263":"\nGene expression analysis is one of the most common and important studies in biology and biomedicine. No matter for traditional blotting analysis or currently commonly used PCR strategy, all need a stable reference gene for normalizing the gene expression. To screen and select housekeeping genes as the most stable reference genes, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to analyze the expression of sixteen commonly used reference genes (IbelF, Ib\u03b1-tubulin, IbHIS, IbCOX, IbGAPDH, IbH2B1, IbARF, IbCYC, Ib\u03b2-tubulin, IbACT, IbEFl-a, IbG14, IbPLD, IbRPL2, IbUBQ, IbUBI) in five different tissues under two different temperature stresses in sweet potato. Data analysis by the Delta CT, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper programs revealed that IbelF is the most stable gene and IbUBI is the least stable gene as reference. Our study also shows that combination of two or more genes as reference is a better choice, rendering more substantiated expression data for comparison.

Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified multiple independent genetic loci that harbour variants associated with major depression, but the exact causal genes and biological mechanisms are largely unknown. Tissue-specific network approaches may identify molecular mechanisms underlying major depression and provide a biological substrate for integrative analyses. We provide a framework for the identification of individual risk genes and gene co-expression networks using genome-wide association summary statistics and gene expression information across multiple human brain tissues and whole blood. We developed a novel gene-based method called eMAGMA that leverages tissue-specific eQTL information to identify 99 biologically plausible risk genes associated with major depression, of which 58 are novel. Among these novel associations is Complement Factor 4A (C4A), recently implicated in schizophrenia through its role in synaptic pruning during postnatal development. Major depression risk genes were enriched in gene co-expression modules in multiple brain tissues and the implicated gene modules contained genes involved in synaptic signalling, neuronal development, and cell transport pathways. Modules enriched with major depression signals were strongly preserved across brain tissues, but were weakly preserved in whole blood, highlighting the importance of using disease-relevant tissues in genetic studies of psychiatric traits. We identified tissue-specific genes and gene co-expression networks associated with major depression. Our novel analytical framework can be used to gain fundamental insights into the functioning of the nervous system in major depression and other brain-related traits.\n","265":"\nColon cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies and is a leading cause of cancer\u2011associated mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying colon cancer and identify potentially significant genes associated with the disease using weighted gene co\u2011expression network analysis\u00a0(WGCNA). The test datasets used were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas\u00a0(TCGA) database. WGCNA was applied to analyze microarray data obtained from colon adenocarcinoma samples to identify significant modules and highly associated genes. A gene co\u2011expression network was constructed and different gene modules were selected. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of colon cancer. In addition, highly connected hub genes associated with the most significant module were selected for further analysis. Nine specific modules associated with colon cancer were identified, of which the turquoise module was observed to exhibit the greatest association with the disease. Pathway enrichment analysis of the turquoise module suggested that genes in the turquoise module were associated with 'RNA polymerase' and 'purine metabolism'. Furthermore, gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed the top 30 hub genes with a higher degree in the turquoise module, such as \u03c3\u2011non\u2011opioid intracellular receptor\u00a01, transmembrane protein\u00a0147 \u00a0TMEM147) and carbamoyl\u2011phosphate synthetase\u00a02, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase, were predominantly enriched in the biological processes 'translation' and 'gene expression'. Experimental verification demonstrated that the expression of TMEM147 in colon cancer was significantly increased compared with the control. Therefore, the results suggested that genes associated with RNA polymerase and the purine metabolic pathways may be substantially involved in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Furthermore, TMEM147 may represent a biomarker for colon cancer.\n","266":"\nRetinoblastoma (Rb) is the most prevalent intraocular pediatric malignancy of the retina. Significant genetic factors are known to have a role in the development of Rb.\nHere, we report the mutation status of 4813 clinically significant genes in six patients with noncarrier of RB1 gene mutation and having normal RB1 promoter methylation from three families having higher risk for developing Rb in the study.\nA total of 27 variants were detected in the study. Heterozygous missense variants c.1162G\u00a0>\u00a0A (p.Gly388Arg) in the FGFR4 gene; c.559C\u00a0>\u00a0T (p.Pro187Ser) in the NQO1 gene were identified.

This study aimed to screen critical genes and miRNAs involved in childhood atopic asthma. DNA methylation and gene expression data (access numbers GSE65163 and GSE65204) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included 72 atopic asthmatic subject samples and 69 healthy samples. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with DNA methylation changes were identified, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Gene coexpression network and miRNA-target gene regulatory networks were then constructed. Besides, we screened critical drug molecules that have high correlation with atopic asthma in children. A total of 146 critical DEGs with DNA methylation changes were screened from atopic asthmatic samples compared with healthy control samples. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the critical genes were mainly related to 20 GO terms and 13 KEGG pathways. In the coexpression network, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP alpha 1 (HLA-DPA1) were identified that were significantly related to immune response process. Analysis of miRNA-target gene network showed that hsa-miR-148b had the highest number of target genes(degree\u2009=\u200921). Besides, we found that Alsterpaullone had a correlation value closest to -1 (correlation\u2009=\u2009-0.884, p\u2009=\u20090.0031), which indicated that the agent might be considered as a potential agent that antagonized to asthma.

Biased loss of most duplicates enriched the genome for specific genes, such as slow evolving genes, but this selective retention process is not well understood. To understand what drives the long-term preservation of duplicate genes, we characterized duplicated genes in terms of their expression patterns. We used a new method of expression enrichment analysis, TopAnat, applied to in situ hybridization data from thousands of genes from zebrafish and mouse. We showed that the presence of expression in the nervous system is a good predictor of a higher rate of retention of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Further analyses suggest that purifying selection against the toxic effects of misfolded or misinteracting proteins, which is particularly strong in nonrenewing neural tissues, likely constrains the evolution of coding sequences of nervous system genes, leading indirectly to the preservation of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Whole-genome duplications thus greatly contributed to the expansion of the toolkit of genes available for the evolution of profound novelties of the nervous system at the base of the vertebrate radiation.\n\u00a9 The Author 2017.

In this study, we identified 89 MC genes in the genomes of four Gossypium species (Gossypium raimondii, Gossypium barbadense, Gossypium hirsutum, and Gossypium arboreum), and classified them as type-I or type-II genes. All of the type-I and type-II MC genes contain a sequence encoding the peptidase C14 domain. During developmentally regulated PCD, type-II MC genes may play an important role related to fiber elongation, while type-I genes may affect the thickening of the secondary wall. Additionally, 13 genes were observed to be differentially expressed between two cotton lines with differing fiber strengths, and four genes (GhMC02, GhMC04, GhMC07, and GhMC08) were predominantly expressed in cotton fibers at 5-30 days post-anthesis (DPA). During environmentally induced PCD, the expression levels of four genes were affected in the root, stem, and leaf tissues within 6 h of an abiotic stress treatment. In general, the MC gene family affects the development of cotton fibers, including fiber elongation and fiber thickening while four prominent fiber- expressed genes were identified. The effects of the abiotic stress and hormone treatments imply that the cotton MC gene family may be important for fiber development. The data presented herein may form the foundation for future investigations of the MC gene family in Gossypium species.\n","270":"\nGene expression analysis represents a powerful approach to characterize the specific mechanisms by which contaminants interact with organisms. One of the key considerations when conducting gene expression analyses using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the selection of appropriate reference genes, which is often overlooked. Specifically, to reach meaningful conclusions when using relative quantification approaches, expression levels of reference genes must be highly stable and cannot vary as a function of experimental conditions. However, to date, information on the stability of commonly used reference genes across developmental stages, tissues and after exposure to contaminants such as metals is lacking for many vertebrate species including teleost fish. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the stability of expression of 8 reference gene candidates in the gills and skin of three different early life-stages of rainbow trout after acute exposure (24h) to two metals, cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) using qPCR. Candidate housekeeping genes were: beta actin (b-actin), DNA directed RNA polymerase II subunit I (DRP2), elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1a), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), ribosomal protein L8 (RPL8), and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S). Four algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative \u0394Ct method were employed to systematically evaluate the expression stability of these candidate genes under control and exposed conditions as well as across three different life-stages. Finally, stability of genes was ranked by taking geometric means of the ranks established by the different methods. Stability of reference genes was ranked in the following order (from lower to higher stability): HPRT<GAPDH<EF1a<G6PD<RPL8<DRP2<b-actin in gills of fish exposed to Cd; b-actin<GAPDH<G6PD<DRP2<RPL8<HPRT<EF1a in gills of fish exposed to Cu; RPL8<HPRT<GAPDH<G6PD<EF1a<DRP2<b-actin in the skin of fish exposed to Cd; and EF1a<GAPDH<RPL8<HPRT<G6PD<b-actin<DRP2 in the skin of fish exposed to Cu. The results demonstrated that the stability of reference genes depended on the metal, life-stage and\/or organ in question. Thus, attention should be paid to these factors before selection of reference gene for relative quantification of the gene expressions.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Though existence of a universal reference gene is myth, commonly used reference genes can be assessed for expression stability to confer their suitability to be used as candidate reference genes in gene expression studies. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of ten most commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, HSP90, HMBS, 18S rRNA, B2M, POLR2A, HPRT1, ACAC, YWHAZ) in fourteen different Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infected tissues of goats and sheep. RefFinder and RankAggreg software were used to deduce comprehensive ranking of reference genes. Our results suggested HMBS and B2M in goats and HMBS and HPRT1 in sheep can be used as suitable endogenous controls in gene expression studies of PPRV infection irrespective of tissues and condition as a whole, thus eliminating the use of tissue specific\/ condition specific endogenous controls. We report for the first time suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in PPRV infected tissues.

We investigated the suitability of nine candidate reference genes: \u03b2-act, \u03b2-tub, adp-rf, ef1-\u03b1, sdha, rpl2, mbp1, psm1, and rGTPa for gene expression analysis in the dermatophyte M. canis in response to different carbon sources, phosphate levels, and pH shifts - factors that are extremely important and necessary for growth of dermatophyte in the host tissue. The transcription stability of these genes was evaluated using NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, and RefFinder software. Regarding expression stability, mbp1, \u03b2-act, and sdha were the most stable housekeeping genes which we recommend for future qRT-PCR studies on M. canis strains.

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to construct a co-expression network and identify gene modules correlated with TNM clinical staging of COAD patients. The Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed with the module gene. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and hub gene identification were explored with Cytoscape software. Finally, the hub gene mRNA level was validated in Oncomine database. Five gene modules, related with the pathological TNM stage, were constructed, and the gene module was enriched in cell proliferation, invasion and migration related GO terms and metabolic related KEGG pathways. A total of top 10 hub genes was identified, and in which six of the hub genes show a significant up-regulation in COAD as compared to normal tissue, including IVL, KRT16, KRT6C, KRT6A, KRT78 and SBSN. In conclusion, we identified five gene modules and six candidate biomarkers correlated with the TNM staging of COAD patients.

In 2009, a guideline called the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) highlighted the importance of the selection and validation of more than one suitable reference gene for obtaining reliable RT-qPCR results. Herein, we searched the recent literature in order to identify the bacterial reference genes that have been most commonly validated in gene expression studies by RT-qPCR (in the first 5\u00a0years following publication of the MIQE guidelines). Through a combination of different search parameters with the text mining tool MedlineRanker, we identified 145 unique bacterial genes that were recently tested as candidate reference genes. Of these, 45 genes were experimentally validated and, in most of the cases, their expression stabilities were verified using the software tools geNorm and NormFinder. It is noteworthy that only 10 of these reference genes had been validated in two or more of the studies evaluated. An enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology classifications demonstrated that genes belonging to the functional categories of DNA Replication (GO: 0006260) and Transcription (GO: 0006351) rendered a proportionally higher number of validated reference genes. Three genes in the former functional class were also among the top five most stable genes identified through an analysis of gene expression data obtained from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center. These results may provide a guideline for the initial selection of candidate reference genes for RT-qPCR studies in several different bacterial species. \n","275":"\nThere exists a plethora of measures to evaluate functional similarity (FS) between genes, which is a widely used in many bioinformatics applications including detecting molecular pathways, identifying co-expressed genes, predicting protein-protein interactions, and prioritization of disease genes. Measures of FS between genes are mostly derived from Information Contents (IC) of Gene Ontology (GO) terms annotating the genes. However, existing measures evaluating IC of terms based either on the representations of terms in the annotating corpus or on the knowledge embedded in the GO hierarchy do not consider the enrichment of GO terms by the querying pair of genes. The enrichment of a GO term by a pair of gene is dependent on whether the term is annotated by one gene (i.e., partial annotation) or by both genes (i.e. complete annotation) in the pair. In this paper, we propose a method that incorporate enrichment of GO terms by a gene pair in computing their FS and show that GO enrichment improves the performances of 46 existing FS measures in the prediction of sequence homologies, gene expression correlations, protein-protein interactions, and disease associated genes.\n","276":"\nThe multiresistance plasmid pAFS11, obtained from a bovine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolate, was completely sequenced and analysed for its structure and organisation. Moreover, the susceptibility to the heavy metals cadmium and copper was determined by broth macrodilution. The 49,189-bp plasmid harboured the apramycin resistance gene apmA, two copies of the macrolide\/lincosamide\/streptogramin B resistance gene erm(B) (both located on remnants of a truncated transposon Tn917), the kanamycin\/neomycin resistance gene aadD, the tetracycline resistance gene tet(L) and the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK. The latter three genes were part of a 7,284-bp segment which was bracketed by two copies of IS431. In addition, the cadmium resistance operon cadDX as well as the copper resistance genes copA and mco were located on the plasmid and mediated a reduced susceptibility to cadmium and copper. Moreover, a complete novel ica-like gene cluster of so far unknown genetic origin was detected on this plasmid. The ica-like gene cluster comprised four different genes whose products showed 64.4-76.9% homology to the Ica proteins known to be involved in biofilm formation of the S. aureus strains Mu50, Mu3 and N315. However, 96.2-99.4% homology was seen to proteins from S. sciuri NS1 indicating an S. sciuri origin. The finding of five different antibiotic resistance genes co-located on a plasmid with heavy metal resistance genes and an ica-like gene cluster is alarming. With the acquisition of this plasmid, antimicrobial multiresistance, heavy metal resistances and potential virulence properties may be co-selected and spread via a single horizontal gene transfer event.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

With the increased availability of high-throughput methods for measuring gene expression, whole-transcriptome approaches may be increasingly utilized for reference gene selection and validation. In this study, RNA-seq was used to identify a set of novel qPCR reference genes and evaluate a panel of traditional \"housekeeping\" reference genes in two species of the evolutionary model plant genus Mimulus More broadly, the methods proposed in this study can be used to harness the power of transcriptomes to identify appropriate reference genes for qPCR in any study organism, including emerging and nonmodel systems. We find that RNA-seq accurately estimates gene expression means in comparison to qPCR, and that expression means are robust to moderate environmental and genetic variation. However, measures of expression variability were only in agreement with qPCR for samples obtained from a shared environment. This result, along with transcriptome-wide comparisons, suggests that environmental changes have greater impacts on expression variability than on expression means. We discuss how this issue can be addressed through experimental design, and suggest that the ever-expanding pool of published transcriptomes represents a rich and low-cost resource for developing better reference genes for qPCR.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Stanton et al.\n","278":"\nDiscovering novel genes that are involved human diseases is a challenging task in biomedical research. In recent years, several computational approaches have been proposed to prioritize candidate disease genes. Most of these methods are mainly based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, since these PPI networks contain false positives and only cover less half of known human genes, their reliability and coverage are very low. Therefore, it is highly necessary to fuse multiple genomic data to construct a credible gene similarity network and then infer disease genes on the whole genomic scale.\nWe proposed a novel method, named RWRB, to infer causal genes of interested diseases. First, we construct five individual gene (protein) similarity networks based on multiple genomic data of human genes. Then, an integrated gene similarity network (IGSN) is reconstructed based on similarity network fusion (SNF) method. Finally, we employee the random walk with restart algorithm on the phenotype-gene bilayer network, which combines phenotype similarity network, IGSN as well as phenotype-gene association network, to prioritize candidate disease genes. We investigate the effectiveness of RWRB through leave-one-out cross-validation methods in inferring phenotype-gene relationships. Results show that RWRB is more accurate than state-of-the-art methods on most evaluation metrics. Further analysis shows that the success of RWRB is benefited from IGSN which has a wider coverage and higher reliability comparing with current PPI networks. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive case study for Alzheimer's disease and predict some novel disease genes that supported by literature.\nRWRB is an effective and reliable algorithm in prioritizing candidate disease genes on the genomic scale.

In this study, we evaluated typical genes to determine whether they were effective at different levels of diatom clustering analysis to assess the potential of these regions for barcoding taxa. Our test genes included nuclear rRNA genes (the nuclear small-subunit rRNA gene and the 5.8S rRNA gene+ITS-2), a mitochondrial gene (cytochrome c-oxidase subunit 1, COI), a chloroplast gene [ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase\/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL)] and the universal plastid amplicon (UPA). Calculated genetic divergence was highest for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS; 5.8S+ITS-2) (p-distance of 1.569, 85.84% parsimony-informative sites) and COI (6.084, 82.14%), followed by the 18S rRNA gene (0.139, 57.69%), rbcL (0.120, 42.01%) and UPA (0.050, 14.97%), which indicated that ITS and COI were highly divergent compared with the other tested genes, and that their nucleotide compositions were variable within the whole group of diatoms. Bayesian inference (BI) analysis showed that the phylogenetic trees generated from each gene clustered diatoms at different phylogenetic levels. The 18S rRNA gene was better than the other genes in clustering higher diatom taxa, and both the 18S rRNA gene and rbcL performed well in clustering some lower taxa. The COI region was able to barcode species of some genera within the Bacillariophyceae. ITS was a potential marker for DNA based-taxonomy and DNA barcoding of Thalassiosirales, while species of Cyclotella, Skeletonema and Stephanodiscus gathered in separate clades, and were paraphyletic with those of Thalassiosira. Finally, UPA was too conserved to serve as a diatom barcode.\n\u00a9 2015 IUMS.\n","280":"\nThis study aim to identify the core pathogenic genes and explore the potential molecular mechanisms of human coronary artery disease (CAD).\nTwo gene profiles of epicardial adipose tissue from CAD patients including GSE 18612 and GSE 64554 were downloaded and integrated by R software packages. All the coexpression of deferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were picked out and analyzed by DAVID online bioinformatic tools. In addition, the DEGs were totally typed into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to get the interaction data among all coexpression genes. Pictures were drawn by cytoscape software with the PPI networks data. CytoHubba were used to predict the hub genes by degree analysis. Finally all the top 10 hub genes and prediction genes in Molecular complex detection were analyzed by Gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis. qRT-PCR were used to identified all the 10 hub genes.\nThe top 10 hub genes calculated by the degree method were AKT1, MYC, EGFR, ACTB, CDC42, IGF1, FGF2, CXCR4, MMP2 and LYN, which relevant with the focal adhesion pathway. Module analysis revealed that the focal adhesion was also acted an important role in CAD, which was consistence with cytoHubba. All the top 10 hub genes were verified by qRT-PCR which presented that AKT1, EGFR, CDC42, FGF2, and MMP2 were significantly decreased in epicardial adipose tissue of CAD samples (p < 0.05) and MYC, ACTB, IGF1, CXCR4, and LYN were significantly increased (p < 0.05).\nThese candidate genes could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of CAD.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Weitie Wang et al.\n","281":"\nProtein turnover is required for muscle growth and regeneration and several proteolytic enzymes, including the calpains, degrade myofibrillar proteins during this process. In a previous experiment, phenotypic differences were observed between \u03bc-calpain knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice, including nutrient accretion and fiber type differences. These changes were particularly evident as the animals aged. Thus, we utilized 18 mice (9 KO and 9 WT) to compare transcript abundance to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 52\u202fwk of age. A total of 55 genes were differentially expressed, including adiponectin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, uncoupling protein 1, and lysine deficient protein kinase 2. These genes were analyzed for over- and underrepresented gene ontology (GO) terms. Several GO terms, including response to cytokine, response to interferon-beta, regulation of protein phosphorylation, and hydrolase activity, were identified as overrepresented. Pathways related to taurine biosynthesis, nitric oxide synthase signaling, amyloid processing, and L-cysteine degradation were also identified. Our results are consistent with previous experiments, in that identified DEGs may explain, at least in part, some of the phenotypic differences between \u03bc-calpain KO and WT mice. Clearly muscle growth and maintenance are complex, multifaceted processes. Genes affected by the silencing of the \u03bc-calpain gene have been identified, but the relationship between \u03bc-calpain and these pathways requires further investigation.\nPublished by Elsevier B.V.\n","282":"\nPast research has shown that virus-induced phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene silencing via agroinjection in the attached and detached fruit of tomato plants results in a pale-yellow fruit phenotype. Although the PDS gene is often used as a marker for gene silencing in tomatoes, little is known about the role of PDS in fruit ripening. In this study, we investigated whether the pepper PDS gene silenced endogenous PDS genes in the fruit of two tomato cultivars, Dotaerang Plus and Legend Summer.\nWe found that the pepper PDS gene successfully silenced endogenous PDS in tomato fruit at a silencing frequency of 100% for both cultivars. A pale-yellow silenced area was observed over virtually the entire surface of individual fruit due to the transcriptional reduction in phytoene desaturase (PDS), zeta-carotene (ZDS), prolycopene isomerase (CrtlSO), and beta-carotene hydroxylase (CrtR-b2), which are the carotenoid biosynthesis genes responsible for the red coloration in tomatoes. PDS silencing also affected the expression levels of the fruit-ripening genes Tomato AGAMOUS-LIKE1 (TAGL1), RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN), pectin esterase gene (PE), lipoxygenase (LOX), FRUITFULL1\/FRUITFUL2 (FUL1\/FUL2), and the ethylene biosynthesis and response genes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase 1 and 3 (ACO1 and ACO3) and ethylene-responsive genes (E4 and E8).\nThese results suggest that PDS is a positive regulator of ripening in tomato fruit, which must be considered when using it as a marker for virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) experiments in order to avoid fruit-ripening side effects.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.\n","283":"\nThe root-knot nematode (RKN) is one of the most dangerous and widespread types of nematodes affecting tomatoes. There are few methods for controlling nematodes in tomatoes. Nature resistance genes (R-genes) are important in conferring resistance against nematodes.

The major problem is that their resistance breaks down at high temperatures. Some of these genes still work at high temperatures.

A total of 25 candidate reference genes including traditional and new generation reference genes were selected and evaluated in a diverse set of chickpea samples. The samples used in this study included nine chickpea genotypes (Cicer spp.) comprising of cultivated and wild species, six abiotic stress treatments (drought, salinity, high vapor pressure deficit, abscisic acid, cold and heat shock), and five diverse tissues (leaf, root, flower, seedlings and seed). The geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder algorithms used to identify stably expressed genes in four sample sets revealed stable expression of UCP and G6PD genes across genotypes, while TIP41 and CAC were highly stable under abiotic stress conditions. While PP2A and ABCT genes were ranked as best for different tissues, ABCT, UCP and CAC were most stable across all samples. This study demonstrated the usefulness of new generation reference genes for more accurate qPCR based gene expression quantification in cultivated as well as wild chickpea species. Validation of the best reference genes was carried out by studying their impact on normalization of aquaporin genes PIP1;4 and TIP3;1, in three contrasting chickpea genotypes under high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) treatment. The chickpea TIP3;1 gene got significantly up regulated under high VPD conditions with higher relative expression in the drought susceptible genotype, confirming the suitability of the selected reference genes for expression analysis. This is the first comprehensive study on the stability of the new generation reference genes for qPCR studies in chickpea across species, different tissues and abiotic stresses. \n","285":"\nCorneal epithelial cells (CECs) are required for corneal transparency and visual function, and corneal injuries may cause corneal blindness.

GO and KEGG pathway of differently expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched using DAVID. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were then constructed using Cytoscape and highly interconnected module was subsequently isolated from the network by Molecular Complex Detection. Expression of the hub genes and other selected genes were then verified by qRT-PCR.\nWe found 112 upregulated and 105 downregulated genes in CECs compared with SESCs. These DEGs were significantly enriched in focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt and TNF signaling pathway. Highly interconnected module of PPI network contains ten genes. Further regulatory network of these genes showed that ESR1 and SLC2A4 were hub genes.\nOur study identified gene expression in SESCs and CECs and suggested that several crucial genes and pathways may play critical roles in transdifferentiation from SESCs to CECs.

Modules that highly correlated with BC development were carried out functional enrichment analysis for annotation, visualization, and integration discovery. The hub genes detected by WGCNA were also confirmed using the Oncomine dataset.We detected 17 transcriptional modules in total and 4 - namely tan, greenyellow, turquoise, and brown - were highly correlated with BC development. The functions of these 4 modules mainly concerned cell migration (tan module, P\u200a=\u200a3.03\u200a\u00d7\u200a10), the cell cycle (greenyellow module, P\u200a=\u200a3.08\u200a\u00d7\u200a10), cell-cell adhesion (turquoise module, P\u200a=\u200a.002), and the extracellular exosome (brown module, P\u200a=\u200a1.38\u200a\u00d7\u200a10). WGCNA also mined the hub genes, which were highly correlated with the genes in the same module and with BC development. The Oncomine database confirmed that the expressions levels of 6 hub genes were significantly higher in BC tissues than in normal tissues, with fold changes larger than 2 (all P\u200a<\u200a.05). Apart from the 2 well-known genes EPCAM and MELK, during the development of BC, KRT8, KRT19, KPNA2, and ECT2 also play key roles, and may be used as new targets for the detection or treatment of BC.In summary, our study demonstrated that hub genes such as EPCAM and MELK are highly correlated with breast cancer development. However, KRT8, KRT19, KPNA2, and ECT2 may also have potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of IBC.\n","287":"\nThe functional consequences of whole genome duplications in vertebrate evolution are not fully understood. It remains unclear, for instance, why paralogues were retained in some gene families but extensively lost in others. Cdx homeobox genes encode conserved transcription factors controlling posterior development across diverse bilaterians. These genes are part of the ParaHox gene cluster. Multiple Cdx copies were retained after genome duplication, raising questions about how functional divergence, overlap, and redundancy respectively contributed to their retention and evolutionary fate.\nWe examined the degree of regulatory and functional overlap between the three vertebrate Cdx genes using single and triple morpholino knock-down in Xenopus tropicalis followed by RNA-seq. We found that one paralogue, Cdx4, has a much stronger effect on gene expression than the others, including a strong regulatory effect on FGF and Wnt genes. Functional annotation revealed distinct and overlapping roles and subtly different temporal windows of action for each gene. The data also reveal a colinear-like effect of Cdx genes on Hox genes, with repression of Hox paralogy groups 1 and 2, and activation increasing from Hox group 5 to 11. We also highlight cases in which duplicated genes regulate distinct paralogous targets revealing pathway elaboration after whole genome duplication.\nDespite shared core pathways, Cdx paralogues have acquired distinct regulatory roles during development. This implies that the degree of functional overlap between paralogues is relatively low and that gene expression pattern alone should be used with caution when investigating the functional evolution of duplicated genes. We therefore suggest that developmental programmes were extensively rewired after whole genome duplication in the early evolution of vertebrates.\n","288":"\nBrassica juncea is a chief oil yielding crop in many parts of the world including India.

The virtue of the reference genes, being constant in expression throughout the experimental treatments, needs to be validated case by case. Appropriate reference gene(s) for normalization of gene-expression data in B.\u00a0juncea during the biotic stress of aphid infestation is not known. In the present investigation, 11 reference genes identified from microarray database of Arabidopsis-aphid interaction at a cut off FDR \u22640.1, along with two known reference genes of B.\u00a0juncea, were analyzed for their expression stability upon aphid infestation.

Ranking orders of the reference genes in terms of expression stability were calculated using advanced statistical approaches such as geNorm, NormFinder, delta Ct and BestKeeper. The analysis suggested CAC, TUA and DUF179 as the most suitable reference genes. Further, normalization of the gene-expression data of STP4 and PR1 by the most and the least stable reference gene, respectively has demonstrated importance and applicability of the recommended reference genes in aphid infested samples of B.\u00a0juncea.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A growing body of evidence suggests that alcohol exposure profoundly impacts a wide range of cytokines and other inflammation-related genes in the CNS. The olfactory system serves as a critical interface between infectious\/inflammatory signals and other aspects of CNS function, and demonstrates long-lasting plasticity in response to alcohol exposure. We therefore utilized transcriptome profiling to identify gene expression patterns for immune-related gene families in the olfactory bulb of Long Evans rats. Pregnant dams received either an ad libitum liquid diet containing 35% daily calories from ethanol (ET), a pair-fed diet (PF) matched for caloric content, or free choice (FCL) access to the liquid diet and water from Gestational Day (GD) 11-20. Offspring were fostered to dams fed the FCL diet, weaned on P21, and then housed with same-sex littermates until mid-adolescence (P40) or young adulthood (P90). At the target ages of P40 or P90, offspring were euthanized via brief CO2 exposure and brains\/blood were collected. Gene expression analysis was performed using a Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), and preliminary analyses focused on two moderately overlapping gene clusters, including all immune-related genes and those related to neuroinflammation. A total of 146 genes were significantly affected by prenatal Diet condition, whereas the factor of Age (P40 vs P90) revealed 998 genes significantly changed, and the interaction between Diet and Age yielded 162 significant genes. From this dataset, we applied a threshold of 1.3-fold change (30% increase or decrease in expression) for inclusion in later analyses. Findings indicated that in adolescents, few genes were altered by PAE, whereas adults displayed an increase of a wide range of gene upregulation as a result of PAE. Pathway analysis predicted an increase in Nf-\u03baB activation in adolescence and a decrease in adulthood due to prenatal ethanol exposure, indicating age-specific and long-lasting alterations to immune signaling. These data may provide important insight into the relationship between immune-related signaling cascades and long-term changes in olfactory bulb function after PAE.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Too often there is little regard to the selection of reference genes and the impact that a poor choice has on data interpretation.

Using ovine efferent lymph cells and peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs), the two most frequently used leukocytes in immunological studies, we have compared the stability of transcription of the most commonly used ovine reference genes: YWHAZ, RPL-13A, PGK1, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT, SDHA and ACTB. Using established algorithms for reference gene normalization \"geNorm\" and \"Norm Finder\", PGK1, GAPDH and YWHAZ were deemed the most stably transcribed genes for efferent leukocytes and PGK1, YWHAZ and SDHA were optimal in PBMCs.

The study of the circadian clock often requires expression profiling of genes over a large number of samples for which RT-qPCR is invariably used. Reliability of the results depends largely on the house-keeping genes, which serve as control and thus should be chosen carefully to prevent erroneous results. In this study, ten house-keeping genes were chosen from rice for stability analysis with 48 tissue samples harvested from plants subjected to diurnal\/circadian cycles. Although, all the genes were found to be stable, however, six of them showed cyclic expression patterns and caused major changes in the expression profiles of the target genes when used to normalize their expression data, thereby making them poor candidates for diurnal\/circadian studies. In conclusion, reference genes need to be selected for diurnal\/circadian studies with extra caution as more than 80% of transcriptome in plants undergoes cycling, which remains undetected by the gene stability assessment software and can severely affect the RT-qPCR based gene expression profiling. The geometric mean of two or more most stable reference genes is hence recommended for diurnal\/circadian studies in plants.\n","292":"\nRepeated artificial selection of a complex trait facilitates the identification of genes underlying the trait, especially if multiple selected descendant lines are available.

From a pedigree analysis, we selected 30 cultivars including the \"miracle rice\" IR8, a GR landmark, its ancestors and descendants, and also other related cultivars for identifying high-yield genes. Through sequencing of these genomes, we identified 28 ancestral chromosomal blocks that were maintained in all the high-yield cultivars under study. In these blocks, we identified six genes of known function, including the GR gene sd1, and 123 loci with genes of unknown function. We randomly selected 57 genes from the 123 loci for knockout or knockdown studies and found that a high proportion of these genes are essential or have phenotypic effects related to rice production. Notably, knockout lines have significant changes in plant height (P < 0.003), a key GR trait, compared with wild-type lines. Some gene knockouts or knockdowns were especially interesting. For example, knockout of Os10g0555100, a putative glucosyltransferase gene, showed both reduced growth and altered panicle architecture. In addition, we found that in some retained chromosome blocks several GR-related genes were clustered, although they have unrelated sequences, suggesting clustering of genes with similar functions.

Given the vast archive of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks in transplant centers, a reliable protocol for utilizing this tissue bank for clinical validation of target molecules as predictors of graft outcome over time, would be of great value. Methods: We designed and optimized assays to quantify 19 target genes, including previously reported set of tissue common rejection module (tCRM) genes. We interrogated their performance for their clinical utility for detection of graft rejection and inflammation by analyzing gene expression microarrays analysis of 163 renal allograft biopsies, and subsequently validated in 40 independent FFPE archived kidney transplant biopsies at a single center. Results: A QPCR (Fluidigm) and a barcoded oligo-based (NanoString) gene expression platform were compared for evaluation of amplification of gene expression signal for 19 genes from degraded RNA extracted from FFPE biopsy sections by a set protocol. Increased expression of the selected 19 genes, that reflect a combination of specific cellular infiltrates (8\/19 genes) and a graft inflammation score (11\/19 genes which computes the tCRM score allowed for segregation of kidney transplant biopsies with stable allograft function and normal histology from those with histologically confirmed acute rejection (AR; p = 0.0022, QPCR; p = 0.0036, barcoded assay) and many cases of histological borderline inflammation (BL). Serial biopsy shaves used for gene expression were also processed for in-situ hybridization (ISH) for a subset of genes. ISH confirmed a high degree of correlation of signal amplification and tissue localization. Conclusions: Target gene expression amplification across a custom set of genes can identify AR independent of histology, and quantify inflammation from archival kidney transplant biopsy tissue, providing a new tool for clinical correlation and outcome analysis of kidney allografts, without the need for prospective kidney biopsy biobanking efforts.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Sigdel, Nguyen, Liberto, Dobi, Junger, Vincenti, Laszik and Sarwal.\n","294":"\nIn this paper, we compare ndh genes in the plastid genome of many Cymbidium species and three closely related taxa in Orchidaceae looking for evidence of ndh gene degradation. Among the 11 ndh genes, there were frequently large deletions in directly repeated or AT-rich regions. Variation in these degraded ndh genes occurs between individual plants, apparently at population levels in these Cymbidium species. It is likely that ndh gene transfers from the plastome to mitochondrial genome (chondriome) occurred independently in Orchidaceae and that ndh genes in the chondriome were also relatively recently transferred between distantly related species in Orchidaceae. Four variants of the ycf1-rpl32 region, which normally includes the ndhF genes in the plastome, were identified, and some Cymbidium species contained at least two copies of that region in their organellar genomes. The four ycf1-rpl32 variants seem to have a clear pattern of close relationships. Patterns of ndh degradation between closely related taxa and translocation of ndh genes to the chondriome in Cymbidium suggest that there have been multiple bidirectional intracellular gene transfers between two organellar genomes, which have produced different levels of ndh gene degradation among even closely related species.\n","295":"\nRmg8 and Rmg7 are genes for resistance to the wheat blast fungus (Pyricularia oryzae), located on chromosome 2B in hexaploid wheat and chromosome 2A in tetraploid wheat, respectively.

We observed a total of 45,923 cis-eQTLs for 417 unique genes and 2,968 trans-eQTLs affecting 82 unique genes. Two eQTLs were located in known risk regions for endometriosis including LINC00339 on chromosome 1 and VEZT on chromosome 12 and there was evidence for eQTLs that may be target genes in genomic regions associated with other reproductive diseases. Dynamic changes in expression of individual genes across cycle include alterations in both mean expression and transcriptional silencing. Significant effects of cycle stage on mean expression levels were observed for (2,427\/15,262) probes with detectable expression in at least 90% of samples and for (2,877\/9,626) probes expressed in some, but not all samples.

Our results identified U2AF as the best reference gene in Cd, Hg, Cr, and As treated leaves as well as in Hg, Pb, As, and Cr stressed root tissues. In Pb treated leaf tissues, 18S rRNA was demonstrated to be the best reference gene. CYP5 was determined to be the optimal reference gene in Cd treated root tissues. The least stable reference gene was identified to be CYP2 in all tested samples except for root tissues stressed by Pb. To further validate the initial screening results, we used the different sets of combinatory internal reference genes to analyze the expression of two metal transport associated genes (PvZIP4 and PvPDB8) in young leaves and roots of switchgrass. Our results demonstrated that the relative expression of the target genes consistently changed during the treatment when CYP5\/UBQ1, U2AF\/ACT12, eEF1a\/U2AF, or 18S rRNA\/ACT12 were combined as the internal reference genes. However, the time-dependent change pattern of the target genes was significantly altered when CYP2 was used as the internal reference gene. Therefore, the selection of the internal reference genes appropriate for specific experimental conditions is critical to ensure the accuracy and reliability of RT-qPCR. Our findings established a solid foundation to further study the gene regulatory network of switchgrass in response to heavy metal stress.\n","298":"\nA stochastic hydrological process is influenced by both stochastic and deterministic factors. A hydrological time series contains not only pure random components reflecting its inheri-tance characteristics, but also deterministic components reflecting variability characteristics, such as jump, trend, period, and stochastic dependence. As a result, the stochastic hydrological process presents complicated evolution phenomena and rules. To better understand these complicated phenomena and rules, this study described the inheritance and variability characteristics of an inconsistent hydrological series from two aspects: stochastic process simulation and time series analysis. In addition, several frequency analysis approaches for inconsistent time series were compared to reveal the main problems in inconsistency study. Then, we proposed a new concept of hydrological genes origined from biological genes to describe the inconsistent hydrolocal processes. The hydrologi-cal genes were constructed using moments methods, such as general moments, weight function moments, probability weight moments and L-moments. Meanwhile, the five components, including jump, trend, periodic, dependence and pure random components, of a stochastic hydrological process were defined as five hydrological bases. With this method, the inheritance and variability of inconsistent hydrological time series were synthetically considered and the inheritance, variability and evolution principles were fully described. Our study would contribute to reveal the inheritance, variability and evolution principles in probability distribution of hydrological elements.\n","299":"\nIn plant cells, either excess or insufficient iron (Fe) concentration triggers stress responses, therefore it is strictly controlled. Proteasome-mediated degradation through ubiquitination of Fe homeostasis proteins has just become the focus of research in recent years. Deactivating ubiquitin ligases, COP9 signalosome has a central importance in the translational control of various stress responses. The aim of the study was to investigate COP9 signalosome in Fe deficiency response of Strategy I plants. In silico analysis of a set of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes was conducted against the transcriptome of Arabidopsis csn mutant lines using Genevestigator software. Induced and suppressed genes were clustered in a hierarchical way and gene ontology enrichment categories were identified. In wild-type Arabidopsis, CSN genes did not respond to iron deficiency. In csn mutant lines, under Fe-sufficient conditions, hundreds of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes were misregulated. Among the ones previously characterized for their physiological roles under Fe deficiency IRT1, NAS4, BTS, NRAMP1 were down-regulated while AHA2, MTP8, FRD3 were up-regulated. Unexpectedly, from those which were regulated in opposite ways, some had been repeatedly shown to be tightly co-regulated by the same transcription factor, FIT. Two proteins from DELLA family, which were reported to interact with FIT to repress its downstream, were found to be strikingly repressed in csn mutants. Overall, the study underlined that the absence of a functional CSN greatly impacted the regulation of Fe homeostasis-related genes, in a manner which cannot be explained simply by the induction of the master transcription factor, FIT. Correct expression of Fe deficiency-responsive genes requires an intact COP9 signalosome in Arabidopsis.\n","300":"\nThe rice blast fungus causes significant annual harvest losses. It also serves as a genetically-tractable model to study fungal ingress. Whilst pathogenicity determinants have been unmasked and changes in global gene expression described, we know little about Magnaporthe oryzae cell wall remodelling. Our interests, in wall remodelling genes expressed during infection, vegetative growth and under exogenous wall stress, demand robust choice of reference genes for quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR) data normalisation. We describe the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes profiled by qRT-PCR with cDNAs derived during asexual germling development, from sexual stage perithecia and from vegetative mycelium grown under various exogenous stressors. Our Minimum Information for Publication of qRT-PCR Experiments (MIQE) compliant analysis reveals a set of robust reference genes used to track changes in the expression of the cell wall remodelling gene MGG_Crh2 (MGG_00592). We ranked nine candidate reference genes by their expression stability (M) and report the best gene combination needed for reliable gene expression normalisation, when assayed in three tissue groups (Infective, Vegetative, and Global) frequently used in M. oryzae expression studies. We found that MGG_Actin (MGG_03982) and the 40S 27a ribosomal subunit MGG_40s (MGG_02872) proved to be robust reference genes for the Infection group and MGG_40s and MGG_Ef1 (Elongation Factor1-\u03b1) for both Vegetative and Global groups. Using the above validated reference genes, M. oryzae MGG_Crh2 expression was found to be significantly (p<0.05) elevated three-fold during vegetative growth as compared with dormant spores and two fold higher under cell wall stress (Congo Red) compared to growth under optimal conditions. We recommend the combinatorial use of two reference genes, belonging to the cytoskeleton and ribosomal synthesis functional groups, MGG_Actin, MGG_40s, MGG_S8 (Ribosomal subunit 40S S8) or MGG_Ef1, which demonstrated low M values across heterogeneous tissues. By contrast, metabolic pathway genes MGG_Fad (FAD binding domain-containing protein) and MGG_Gapdh (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) performed poorly, due to their lack of expression stability across samples. \n","301":"\nAlthough the HKT transporter genes ascertain some of the key determinants of crop salt tolerance mechanisms, the diversity and functional role of group II HKT genes are not clearly understood in bread wheat. The advanced knowledge on rice HKT and whole genome sequence was, therefore, used in comparative gene analysis to identify orthologous wheat group II HKT genes and their role in trait variation under different saline environments.\nThe four group II HKTs in rice identified two orthologous gene families from bread wheat, including the known TaHKT2;1 gene family and a new distinctly different gene family designated as TaHKT2;2. A single copy of TaHKT2;2 was found on each homeologous chromosome arm 7AL, 7BL and 7DL and each gene was expressed in leaf blade, sheath and root tissues under non-stressed and at 200 mM salt stressed conditions. The proteins encoded by genes of the TaHKT2;2 family revealed more than 93% amino acid sequence identity but \u226452% amino acid identity compared to the proteins encoded by TaHKT2;1 family. Specifically, variations in known critical domains predicted functional differences between the two protein families. Similar to orthologous rice genes on chromosome 6L, TaHKT2;1 and TaHKT2;2 genes were located approximately 3 kb apart on wheat chromosomes 7AL, 7BL and 7DL, forming a static syntenic block in the two species. The chromosomal region on 7AL containing TaHKT2;1 7AL-1 co-located with QTL for shoot Na(+) concentration and yield in some saline environments.\nThe differences in copy number, genes sequences and encoded proteins between TaHKT2;2 homeologous genes and other group II HKT gene families within and across species likely reflect functional diversity for ion selectivity and transport in plants. Evidence indicated that neither TaHKT2;2 nor TaHKT2;1 were associated with primary root Na(+) uptake but TaHKT2;1 may be associated with trait variation for Na(+) exclusion and yield in some but not all saline environments.\n","302":"\nDrip loss is a key aspect of meat quality. Transcriptome profiles of muscle with divergent drip loss would offer important insight into the genetic factors responsible for the trait. In this study, drip loss and other meat quality traits of 28 purebred Duroc pigs were measured, muscles of these individuals were RNA sequenced, and eight individuals with extremely low and high drip loss were selected for analyzing their transcriptome differences and identifying potential candidate genes affecting drip loss.\nAs a result, 363 differentially expressed (DE) genes were detected in the comparative gene expression analysis, of which 239 were up-regulated and 124 were down-regulated in the low drip loss group. The DE genes were further filtered by correlation analysis between their expression and drip loss values in the 28 Duroc pigs measured and comparison of them with QTLs affecting drip loss. Consequently, of the 363 DE genes, 100 were identified as critical DE genes for drip loss. Functional analysis of these critical DE genes revealed some GO terms (extracellular matrix, cell adhesion mediated by integrin, heterotypic cell-cell adhesion), pathway (ECM-receptor interaction), and new potential candidate genes (TNC, ITGA5, ITGA11, THBS3 and CD44) which played an important role in regulating the variation of drip loss, and deserved to carry further studies to unravel their specific mechanism on drip loss.\nOur study revealed some GO terms, pathways and potential candidate genes affecting drip loss. It provides crucial information to understand the molecular mechanism of drip loss, and would be of help for improving meat quality of pigs.\n","303":"\nTea plants [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] are an important leaf-type crop that are widely used for the production of non-alcoholic beverages in the world. Exposure to excessive amounts of heavy metals adversely affects the quality and yield of tea leaves. To analyze the molecular responses of tea plants to heavy metals, a reliable quantification of gene expression is important and of major importance herein is the normalization of the measured expression levels for the target genes. Ideally, stably expressed reference genes should be evaluated in all experimental systems. In this study, 12 candidate reference genes (i.e., 18S rRNA, Actin, CYP, EF-1\u03b1, eIF-4\u03b1, GAPDH, MON1, PP2AA3, TBP, TIP41, TUA, and UBC) were cloned from tea plants, and the stability of their expression was examined systematically in 60 samples exposed to diverse heavy metals (i.e., manganese, aluminum, copper, iron, and zinc). Three Excel-based algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to evaluate the expression stability of these genes. PP2AA3 and 18S rRNA were the most stably expressed genes, even though their expression profiles exhibited some variability. Moreover, commonly used reference genes (i.e., GAPDH and TBP) were the least appropriate reference genes for most samples. To further validate the suitability of the analyzed reference genes, the expression level of a phytochelatin synthase gene (i.e., CsPCS1) was determined using the putative reference genes for data normalizations. Our results may be beneficial for future studies involving the quantification of relative gene expression levels in tea plants.\n","304":"\nThe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most frequently injured structures during high-impact sporting activities. Gene expression analysis may be a useful tool for understanding ACL tears and healing failure. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has emerged as an effective method for such studies. However, this technique requires the use of suitable reference genes for data normalization. Here, we evaluated the suitability of six reference genes (18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, and TBP) by using ACL samples of 39 individuals with ACL tears (20 with isolated ACL tears and 19 with ACL tear and combined meniscal injury) and of 13 controls. The stability of the candidate reference genes was determined by using the NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper DataAssist, and RefFinder software packages and the comparative \u0394Ct method. ACTB was the best single reference gene and ACTB+TBP was the best gene pair. The GenEx software showed that the accumulated standard deviation is reduced when a larger number of reference genes is used for gene expression normalization. However, the use of a single reference gene may not be suitable. To identify the optimal combination of reference genes, we evaluated the expression of FN1 and PLOD1. We observed that at least 3 reference genes should be used. ACTB+HPRT1+18S is the best trio for the analyses involving isolated ACL tears and controls. Conversely, ACTB+TBP+18S is the best trio for the analyses involving (1) injured ACL tears and controls, and (2) ACL tears of patients with meniscal tears and controls. Therefore, if the gene expression study aims to compare non-injured ACL, isolated ACL tears and ACL tears from patients with meniscal tear as three independent groups ACTB+TBP+18S+HPRT1 should be used. In conclusion, 3 or more genes should be used as reference genes for analysis of ACL samples of individuals with and without ACL tears. \n","305":"\nApoptosis- and proliferation-effector genes are substantially regulated by the same transactivators, with E2F-1 and Oct-1 being notable examples. The larger proliferation-effector genes have more binding sites for the transactivators that regulate both sets of genes, and proliferation-effector genes have more regions of active chromatin, i.e, DNase I hypersensitive and histone 3, lysine-4 trimethylation sites. Thus, the size differences between the 2 classes of genes suggest a transcriptional regulation paradigm whereby the accumulation of transcription factors that regulate both sets of genes, merely as an aspect of stochastic behavior, accumulate first on the larger proliferation-effector gene \"traps,\" and then accumulate on the apoptosis effector genes, thereby effecting sequential activation of the 2 different gene sets. As IRF-1 and p53 levels increase, tumor suppressor proteins are first activated, followed by the activation of apoptosis-effector genes, for example during S-phase pausing for DNA repair. Tumor suppressor genes are larger than apoptosis-effector genes and have more IRF-1 and p53 binding sites, thereby likewise suggesting a paradigm for transcription sequencing based on stochastic interactions of transcription factors with different gene classes. In this report, using the ENCODE database, we determined that tumor suppressor genes have a greater number of open chromatin regions and histone 3 lysine-4 trimethylation sites, consistent with the idea that a larger gene size can facilitate earlier transcriptional activation via the inclusion of more transactivator binding sites. \n","306":"\nFunctional characterization of two tobacco genes, one involved in xylan synthesis and the other, a positive regulator of secondary cell wall formation, is reported. Lignocellulosic secondary cell walls (SCW) provide essential plant materials for the production of second-generation bioethanol. Therefore, thorough understanding of the process of SCW formation in plants is beneficial for efficient bioethanol production. Recently, we provided the first proof-of-concept for using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach for rapid functional characterization of nine genes involved in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin synthesis during SCW formation. Here, we report VIGS-mediated functional characterization of two tobacco genes involved in SCW formation. Stems of VIGS plants silenced for both selected genes showed increased amount of xylem formation but thinner cell walls than controls. These results were further confirmed by production of stable transgenic tobacco plants manipulated in expression of these genes. Stems of stable transgenic tobacco plants silenced for these two genes showed increased xylem proliferation with thinner walls, whereas transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing these two genes showed increased fiber cell wall thickness but no change in xylem proliferation. These two selected genes were later identified as possible members of DUF579 family involved in xylan synthesis and KNAT7 transcription factor family involved in positive regulation of SCW formation, respectively. Glycome analyses of cell walls showed increased polysaccharide extractability in 1\u00a0M KOH extracts of both VIGS-NbDUF579 and VIGS-NbKNAT7 lines suggestive of cell wall loosening. Also, VIGS-NbDUF579 and VIGS-NbKNAT7 lines showed increased saccharification rates (74.5 and 40\u00a0% higher than controls, respectively). All these properties are highly desirable for producing higher quantities of bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials of bioenergy plants.\n","307":"\nA molecular approach was applied to the study of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. At first, functional annotation of the genome of R. mucilaginosa C2.5t1 was carried out and gene ontology categories were assigned to 4033 predicted proteins. Then, a set of genes involved in different steps of carotenogenesis was identified and those coding for phytoene desaturase, phytoene synthase\/lycopene cyclase and carotenoid dioxygenase (CAR genes) proved to be clustered within a region of ~10\u2009kb. Quantitative PCR of the genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis showed that genes coding for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-CoA reductase and mevalonate kinase are induced during exponential phase while no clear trend of induction was observed for phytoene synthase\/lycopene cyclase and phytoene dehydrogenase encoding genes. Thus, in R. mucilaginosa the induction of genes involved in the early steps of carotenoid biosynthesis is transient and accompanies the onset of carotenoid production, while that of CAR genes does not correlate with the amount of carotenoids produced. The transcript levels of genes coding for carotenoid dioxygenase, superoxide dismutase and catalase A increased during the accumulation of carotenoids, thus suggesting the activation of a mechanism aimed at the protection of cell structures from oxidative stress during carotenoid biosynthesis. The data presented herein, besides being suitable for the elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie carotenoid biosynthesis, will contribute to boosting the biotechnological potential of this yeast by improving the outcome of further research efforts aimed at also exploring other features of interest.\n","308":"\nQuantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), a sensitive technique for gene expression analysis, depends on the stability of the reference genes used for data normalization under different experimental conditions. Bursaphelenchus mucronatus, a pine-parasitic nematode varying in virulence, is widely distributed in natural pine forests throughout the northern hemisphere, but has not been investigated with respect to the identification of reference genes suitable for the normalization of RT-qPCR data. In the present study, eight candidate reference genes were analyzed in B. mucronatus under different habitat conditions and at different developmental stages. The expression stability of these genes was assessed by geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, delta Cq, and RefFinder algorithms. In general, our results identified encoding beta-tubulin as the most stable gene. Moreover, pairwise analysis showed that three reference genes were sufficient to normalize the gene expression data under each set of conditions, with genes encoding beta-tubulin, 18S ribosomal RNA and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme being the most suitable reference genes for different habitat conditions, whereas genes encoding beta-tubulin, histone, and 18S ribosomal RNA exhibited the most stable expression at different developmental stages. Validation of the selected reference genes was performed by profiling the expression of the fatty acid- and retinol-binding protein gene in different habitats, and by profiling the expression of the arginine kinase gene at different developmental stages. This first systematic analysis for the selection of suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR in B. mucronatus will facilitate future functional analyses and deep mining of genetic resources in this nematode.\n","309":"\nLarge numbers of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting complex diseases and other quantitative traits have been reported in humans and model animals. However, the genetic architecture of these traits remains elusive due to the difficulty in identifying causal quantitative trait genes (QTGs) for common QTL with relatively small phenotypic effects. A traditional strategy based on techniques such as positional cloning does not always enable identification of a single candidate gene for a QTL of interest because it is difficult to narrow down a target genomic interval of the QTL to a very small interval harboring only one gene. A combination of gene expression analysis and statistical causal analysis can greatly reduce the number of candidate genes. This integrated approach provides causal evidence that one of the candidate genes is a putative QTG for the QTL. Using this approach, I have recently succeeded in identifying a single putative QTG for resistance to obesity in mice. Here, I outline the integration approach and discuss its usefulness using my studies as an example.\n","310":"\nWhat is the central question of this study? The aim was to identify abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)-associated microRNAs and their target genes in AAA using microarray analysis. What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding was that miR-145 and miR-30c-2* were found to be downregulated microRNAs in AAA, which could exert suppressive effects on AAA progression, and that miR-145 might target RAC2, whereas miR-30c-2* might target PIK3CD, IL1B and RAC2. The findings obtained from the study provide an enhanced understanding of microRNA as a therapeutic target to limit AAA.\nThe aim of the study was to identify abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes potentially contributing to AAA. Differential analysis was performed to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs in expression datasets of AAA-related miRNAs [GSE51226 (mouse)] and genes [GSE51227 (mouse) and GSE7084 (human)]. Then, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DEGs was compared with aneurysm-related GO to screen out DEGs related to the disease. The target genes of differential miRNAs were predicted and used to construct a miRNA-DEG regulatory network, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of target genes. Moreover, the protein-protein interaction network of target genes of miRNAs in the core position (hub-miRNA) with AAA-related genes was constructed to screen out hub genes. Finally, the target relationship between hub-miRNAs and their target genes was verified. There were 20 upregulated miRNAs and 20 downregulated miRNAs in AAA screened from the GSE51226 dataset (mouse). In addition, there were 1154 upregulated genes and 821 downregulated genes in the GSE51227 dataset (mouse), of which 246 DEGs were enriched in aneurysm-related GO entries in AAA. miR-145 and miR-30c-2* were the key miRNAs of AAA, both of which were downregulated in AAA and influenced pathways so as to affect AAA by regulating their respective target genes. The disease-related gene ACTA2 was downregulated, whereas DEGs including PIK3CD, IL1B, RAC2 and SELL were upregulated in AAA. Finally, it was proved that miR-145 targeted RAC2 and SELL, whereas miR-30c-2* targeted PIK3CD, IL1B and RAC2. Taken together, miR-145 and miR-30c-2*, downregulated in AAA, could potentially affect AAA, and miR-145 might target RAC2, whereas miR-30c-2* might target PIK3CD, IL1B and RAC2.\n\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

However, duplicated genes may have complex phylogenetic topologies due to changes in their evolutionary rates. Here, by constructing phylogenetic trees using different methods, we evaluated the phylogenetic relationships of duplicated genes produced by polyploidization in cotton. We found that at least 83.2% of phylogenetic trees did not conform the expected topology. Moreover, cotton homologous gene copy number has little effect on the topology of duplicated genes. Compared with their cacao orthologs, elevated evolutionary rates of cotton genes are responsible for distorted tree topology. Furthermore, as to both branch and site models, we inferred that positive natural selection during the divergence of fiber-development-related MYB genes was likely, and found that the reconstructed tree topology may often overestimate natural selection, as compared to the inference with the expected trees. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of borrowing precious information from gene collinearity in tree construction and evaluation, and have evidence to alert the citation of thousands of previous reports of adaptivity and functional innovation of duplicated genes.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Meng, Pan, Wang, Yu, Liu, Zhang, Wei, Guo and Wang.\n","312":"\nIn recent years, identification of differentially expressed genes and sample clustering have become hot topics in bioinformatics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used method in gene expression data. However, it has two limitations: first, the geometric structure hidden in data, e.g., pair-wise distance between data points, have not been explored. This information can facilitate sample clustering; second, the Principal Components (PCs) determined by PCA are dense, leading to hard interpretation. However, only a few of genes are related to the cancer. It is of great significance for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer to identify a handful of the differentially expressed genes and find new cancer biomarkers.\nIn this study, a new method gLSPCA is proposed to integrate both graph Laplacian and sparse constraint into PCA. gLSPCA on the one hand improves the clustering accuracy by exploring the internal geometric structure of the data, on the other hand identifies differentially expressed genes by imposing a sparsity constraint on the PCs.\nExperiments of gLSPCA and its comparison with existing methods, including Z-SPCA, GPower, PathSPCA, SPCArt, gLPCA, are performed on real datasets of both pancreatic cancer (PAAD) and head & neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC). The results demonstrate that gLSPCA is effective in identifying differentially expressed genes and sample clustering. In addition, the applications of gLSPCA on these datasets provide several new clues for the exploration of causative factors of PAAD and HNSC.\n","313":"\nSoybeans are an important cash crop and are widely used as a source of vegetable protein and edible oil. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous small RNA that play an important regulatory role in the evolutionarily conserved system of gene expression. In this study, we selected four lines with extreme phenotypes, as well as high or low protein and oil content, from the chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) constructed from suinong (SN14) and ZYD00006, and planted and sampled at three stages of grain development for small RNA sequencing and expression analysis. The sequencing results revealed the expression pattern of miRNA in the materials, and predicted miRNA-targeted regulatory genes, including 1967 pairs of corresponding relationships between known-miRNA and their target genes, as well as 597 pairs of corresponding relationships between novel-miRNA and their target genes. After screening and annotating genes that were targeted for regulation, five specific genes were identified to be differentially expressed during seed development and subsequently analyzed for their regulatory relationship with miRNAs. The expression pattern of the targeted gene was verified by Real-time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Our research provides more information about the miRNA regulatory network in soybeans and further identifies useful genes that regulate storage during soy grain development, providing a theoretical basis for the regulation of soybean quality traits.\n","314":"\nReal-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR is a sensitive and widely used technique to quantify gene expression. To achieve a reliable result, appropriate reference genes are highly required for normalization of transcripts in different samples. In this study, 9 previously published reference genes (60S, Fbox, ELF1A, ELF1B, ACT11, TUA5, UBC4, G6PD, CYP2) of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] were selected. The expression stability of the 9 genes was evaluated under conditions of biotic stress caused by infection with soybean mosaic virus, nitrogen stress, across different cultivars and developmental stages. \u0394Ct and geNorm algorithms were used to evaluate and rank the expression stability of the 9 reference genes. Results obtained from two algorithms showed high consistency. Moreover, results of pairwise variation showed that two reference genes were sufficient to normalize the expression levels of target genes under each experimental setting. For virus infection, ELF1A and ELF1B were the most stable reference genes for accurate normalization. For different developmental stages, Fbox and G6PD had the highest expression stability between two soybean cultivars (Tanlong No. 1 and Tanlong No. 2). ELF1B and ACT11 were identified as the most stably expressed reference genes both under nitrogen stress and among different cultivars. The results showed that none of the candidate reference genes were uniformly expressed at different conditions, and selecting appropriate reference genes was pivotal for gene expression studies with particular condition and tissue. The most stable combination of genes identified in this study will help to achieve more accurate and reliable results in a wide variety of samples in soybean.\n","315":"\nGanoderma lucidum has been considered an emerging model species for studying how environmental factors regulate the growth, development, and secondary metabolism of Basidiomycetes. Heat stress, which is one of the most important environmental abiotic stresses, seriously affects the growth, development, and yield of microorganisms. Understanding the response to heat stress has gradually become a hotspot in microorganism research. But suitable reference genes for expression analysis under heat stress have not been reported in G. lucidum. In this study, we systematically identified 11 candidate reference genes that were measured using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the gene expression stability was analyzed under heat stress conditions using geNorm and NormFinder. The results show that 5 reference genes-CYP and TIF, followed by UCE2, ACTIN, and UBQ1-are the most stable genes under our experimental conditions. Moreover, the relative expression levels of 3 heat stress response genes (hsp17.4, hsp70, and hsp90) were analyzed under heat stress conditions with different normalization strategies. The results show that use of a gene with unstable expression (SAND) as the reference gene leads to biased data and misinterpretations of the target gene expression level under heat stress.\n","316":"\nThe Y chromosome harbors nine multi-copy ampliconic gene families expressed exclusively in testis. The gene copies within each family are >99% identical to each other, which poses a major challenge in evaluating their copy number. Recent studies demonstrated high variation in Y ampliconic gene copy number among humans. However, how this variation affects expression levels in human testis remains understudied. Here we developed a novel computational tool Ampliconic Copy Number Estimator (AmpliCoNE) that utilizes read sequencing depth information to estimate Y ampliconic gene copy number per family. We applied this tool to whole-genome sequencing data of 149 men with matched testis expression data whose samples are part of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We found that the Y ampliconic gene families with low copy number in humans were deleted or pseudogenized in non-human great apes, suggesting relaxation of functional constraints. Among the Y ampliconic gene families, higher copy number leads to higher expression. Within the Y ampliconic gene families, copy number does not influence gene expression, rather a high tolerance for variation in gene expression was observed in testis of presumably healthy men. No differences in gene expression levels were found among major Y haplogroups. Age positively correlated with expression levels of the HSFY and PRY gene families in the African subhaplogroup E1b, but not in the European subhaplogroups R1b and I1. We also found that expression of five Y ampliconic gene families is coordinated with that of their non-Y (i.e. X or autosomal) homologs. Indeed, five ampliconic gene families had consistently lower expression levels when compared to their non-Y homologs suggesting dosage regulation, while the HSFY family had higher expression levels than its X homolog and thus lacked dosage regulation.\n","317":"\nTaste receptors (TRs) are seven trans-membrane G protein-coupled receptors as well as the interface between internal and external milieus, which playing pivotal roles in nutrient identification and acquisition. To better understand the scope and function of tr gene family in common carp, one of the most economic and important breeding fish species, which has undergone an additional round of whole genome duplication (WGD), we characterized 13 tr gene homologues including eight type I and five type II taste receptor genes from common carp genome, which were more than any other teleosts. Phylogenetic and syntenic analysis revealed the evolution dynamics of tr gene family, which was highly conserved, though gene duplication and gene loss do exist recently. Furthermore, the motif and dN\/dS analyses indicated that these receptors were under different negative selection pressure. Additionally, the gene expression divergences were observed in 12 health tissues of common carp, with a relatively high level in barbel and head kidney, demonstrating tissue-specific expression of tr genes in the tetraploidized genome. The overarching goals of this study were to identify the abundance of tr genes in common carp, compare the gene divergence among species with varied feeding habits and provide genomic resources for future studies on teleost taste sensation.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Some members of this gene family are involved in negative regulation of powdery mildew resistance, while others are involved in several other biological functions. Mlo proteins have characteristic seven transmembrane domains and a calmodulin-binding domain at their C-termini, and are associated with plasma membrane. The Mlo gene family has been studied in several economically important cereals, but little information is available on this gene family in the important legumes, Medicago truncatula Gaertn. and Cicer arietinum L. We carried out a comprehensive and comparative investigation of the Mlo gene family in these two species using the genome sequences available at the M. truncatula genome database (Mt v4.0) and NCBI (C. arietinum). A genome-wide homology-based search using Arabidopsis Mlo proteins as query identified 16 MtMlo (M. truncatula Mlo) and 14 CarMlo (C. arietinum Mlo) genes. The MtMlo and CarMlo genes had comparable gene structure, protein sequence and topology. Their chromosomal locations indicated the occurrence of extensive reorganization in the genomes of the two species after their divergence from the common ancestor. A multiple sequence alignment of 53 Mlo proteins from these two and several other species showed a highly conserved sequence block of seven amino acids, viz., L-ETPTW, towards their N-termini. The evolutionary phylogenetic analysis grouped the MtMlo and CarMlo members into four clusters, and most of the MtMlo and CarMlo members formed one-to-one ortholog pairs. The ka\/ks analyses indicated that the MtMlo and CarMlo genes are subjected to intense purifying selection.\n","319":"\nThe chloroplast genome (CPG) of Pinus massoniana belonging to the genus Pinus (Pinaceae), which is a primary source of turpentine, was sequenced and analyzed in terms of gene rearrangements, ndh genes loss, and the contraction and expansion of short inverted repeats (IRs). P. massoniana CPG has a typical quadripartite structure that includes large single copy (LSC) (65,563 bp), small single copy (SSC) (53,230 bp) and two IRs (IRa and IRb, 485 bp). The 108 unique genes were identified, including 73 protein-coding genes, 31 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs. Most of the 81 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified in CPG were mononucleotides motifs of A\/T types and located in non-coding regions. Comparisons with related species revealed an inversion (21,556 bp) in the LSC region; P. massoniana CPG lacks all 11 intact ndh genes (four ndh genes lost completely; the five remained truncated as pseudogenes; and the other two ndh genes remain as pseudogenes because of short insertions or deletions). A pair of short IRs was found instead of large IRs, and size variations among pine species were observed, which resulted from short insertions or deletions and non-synchronized variations between \"IRa\" and \"IRb\". The results of phylogenetic analyses based on whole CPG sequences of 16 conifers indicated that the whole CPG sequences could be used as a powerful tool in phylogenetic analyses.\n","320":"\nAPETALA2\/Ethylene-Responsive transcription factors (AP2\/ERF), with their multifunctional roles in plant development, hormone signaling and stress tolerance, are important candidates for engineering crop plants. Here, we report identification and analysis of gene structure, phylogenetic distribution, expression, chromosomal localization and cis-acting promoter analysis of AP2\/ERF genes in the C4 crop plant sorghum. We identified 158 ERF genes in sorghum with 52 of them encoding dehydration-responsive binding elements (DREB) while 106 code for ERF subfamily proteins. Phylogenetic analysis organized sorghum ERF proteins into 11 distinct groups exhibiting clade-specific expansion. About 68% ERF genes have paralogs indicating gene duplications as major cause of expansion of ERF family in sorghum. Analysis of spatiotemporal expression patterns using publicly available data revealed their tissue\/genotype-preferential accumulation. In addition, 40 ERF genes exhibited differential accumulation in response to heat and\/or drought stress. About 25% of the segmental gene pairs and eleven tandem duplicated genes exhibited high correlation (>\u20090.7) in their expression patterns indicating genetic redundancy. Comparative phylogenomic analysis of sorghum ERFs with 74 genetically characterized ERF genes from other plant species provided significant clues to sorghum ERF functions. Overall data generated here provides an overview of evolutionary relationship among ERF gene family members in sorghum and with respect to previously characterized ERF genes from other plant species. This information will be instrumental in initiating functional genomic studies of ERF candidates in sorghum.\n\u00a9 King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2020.\n","321":"\nThere is a significant difference in prognosis between the germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the signaling pathways and driver genes involved in these disparate subtypes are ambiguous. This study integrated three cohort profile datasets, including 250 GCB samples and 250 ABC samples, to elucidate potential candidate hub genes and key pathways involved in these two subtypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. After Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sub-PPI network analyses were conducted using the STRING database and Cytoscape software. Subsequently, the Oncomine database and the cBioportal online tool were employed to verify the alterations and differential expression of the 8 hub genes (MME, CD44, IRF4, STAT3, IL2RA, ETV6, CCND2, and CFLAR). Gene set enrichment analysis was also employed to identify the intersection of the key pathways (JAK-STAT, FOXO, and NF-\u03baB pathways) validated in the above analyses. These hub genes and key pathways could improve our understanding of the process of tumorigenesis and the underlying molecular events and may be therapeutic targets for the precise treatment of these two subtypes with different prognoses.\n","322":"\n\u03b3\u03b4 T cells recognize a wide variety of ligands in mammals, among them members of the butyrophilin (BTN) family. Nothing is known about \u03b3\u03b4 T cell ligands in chickens, despite there being many such cells in blood and lymphoid tissues, as well as in mucosal surfaces. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chickens was discovered because of polymorphic BG genes, part of the BTN family. All but two BG genes are located in the BG region, oriented head-to-tail so that unequal crossing-over has led to copy number variation (CNV) as well as hybrid (chimeric) genes, making it difficult to identify true alleles. One approach is to examine BG genes expressed in particular cell types, which likely have the same functions in different BG haplotypes and thus can be considered \"functional alleles.\" We cloned nearly full-length BG transcripts from peripheral T cells of four haplotypes (B2, B15, B19, and B21), and compared them to the BG genes of the B12 haplotype that previously were studied in detail. A dominant BG gene was found in each haplotype, but with significant levels of subdominant transcripts in three haplotypes (B2, B15, and B19). For three haplotypes (B15, B19, and B21), most sequences are closely-related to BG8, BG9, and BG12 from the B12 haplotype. We found that variation in the extracellular immunoglobulin-variable-like (Ig-V) domain is mostly localized to the membrane distal loops but without evidence for selection. However, variation in the cytoplasmic tail composed of many amino acid heptad repeats does appear to be selected (although not obviously localized), consistent with an intriguing clustering of charged and polar residues in an apparent \u03b1-helical coiled-coil. By contrast, the dominantly-expressed BG gene in the B2 haplotype is identical to BG13 from the B12 haplotype, and most of the subdominant sequences are from the BG5-BG7-BG11 clade. Moreover, alternative splicing leading to intron read-through results in dramatically truncated cytoplasmic tails, particularly for the dominantly-expressed BG gene of the B2 haplotype. The approach of examining \"functional alleles\" has yielded interesting data for closely-related genes, but also thrown up unexpected findings for at least one haplotype.\n","323":"\nSpecies-specific, new, or \"orphan\" genes account for 10%-30% of eukaryotic genomes. Although initially considered to have limited function, an increasing number of orphan genes have been shown to provide important phenotypic innovation. How new genes acquire regulatory sequences for proper temporal and spatial expression is unknown. Orphan gene regulation may rely in part on origination in open chromatin adjacent to preexisting promoters, although this has not yet been assessed by genome-wide analysis of chromatin states. Here, we combine taxon-rich nematode phylogenies with Iso-Seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq to identify the gene structure and epigenetic signature of orphan genes in the satellite model nematode Pristionchus pacificus Consistent with previous findings, we find young genes are shorter, contain fewer exons, and are on average less strongly expressed than older genes. However, the subset of orphan genes that are expressed exhibit distinct chromatin states from similarly expressed conserved genes. Orphan gene transcription is determined by a lack of repressive histone modifications, confirming long-held hypotheses that open chromatin is important for new gene formation. Yet orphan gene start sites more closely resemble enhancers defined by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq peaks, in contrast to conserved genes that exhibit traditional promoters defined by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Although the majority of orphan genes are located on chromosome arms that contain high recombination rates and repressive histone marks, strongly expressed orphan genes are more randomly distributed. Our results support a model of new gene origination by rare integration into open chromatin near enhancers.\n\u00a9 2018 Werner et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.\n","324":"\nPiscirickettsia salmonis is a highly aggressive facultative intracellular bacterium that challenges the sustainability of Chilean salmon production. Due to the limited knowledge of its biology, there is a need to identify key molecular markers that could help define the pathogenic potential of this bacterium. We think a model system should be implemented that efficiently evaluates the expression of putative bacterial markers by using validated, stable, and highly specific housekeeping genes to properly select target genes, which could lead to identifying those responsible for infection and disease induction in naturally infected fish. Here, we selected a set of validated reference or housekeeping genes for RT-qPCR expression analyses of P. salmonis under different growth and stress conditions, including an in vitro infection kinetic. After a thorough screening, we selected sdhA as the most reliable housekeeping gene able to represent stable and highly specific host reference genes for RT-qPCR-driven P. salmonis analysis.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

They contain high amounts of cellulose and so are used for linen textiles and in the composite industry. In this study, we screened the annotated flax genome and identified 14 distinct cellulose synthase (CESA) genes using orthologous sequences previously identified. Transcriptomics of 'primary cell wall' and 'secondary cell wall' flax CESA genes showed that some were preferentially expressed in different organs and stem tissues providing clues as to their biological role(s) in planta. The development for the first time in flax of a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach was used to functionally evaluate the biological role of different CESA genes in stem tissues. Quantification of transcript accumulation showed that in many cases, silencing not only affected targeted CESA clades, but also had an impact on other CESA genes. Whatever the targeted clade, inactivation by VIGS affected plant growth. In contrast, only clade 1- and clade 6-targeted plants showed modifications in outer-stem tissue organization and secondary cell wall formation. In these plants, bast fibre number and structure were severely impacted, suggesting that the targeted genes may play an important role in the establishment of the fibre cell wall. Our results provide new fundamental information about cellulose biosynthesis in flax that should facilitate future plant improvement\/engineering.\n\u00a9 2015 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n","326":"\nThe genes encoding \u03b2-actin and GAPDH are two of the most commonly used reference genes for normalization in in vitro blood-brain barrier studies. Studies have, however, shown that these reference genes might not always be the best choice. The aim of the present study was to evaluate 10 reference genes for use in mRNA profiling studies in primary cultures of brain endothelial cells of bovine origin.\nGene evaluations were performed by qPCR in mono-culture and in co-cultures with astrocytes. The expression of reference genes was furthermore investigated during culture. Qbase+ software was used to analyze the stability of the tested genes and for determinations of the optimal number of reference genes.\nThe stability of the reference genes varied between the culture configurations, but for all culture configurations we found that the optimal number of reference genes were two. PMM-1, RPL13A and \u03b2-actin were the most stable genes in mono-cultures, non-contact co-culture and contact co-culture respectively. For studies comparing gene expression between different culture configurations the optimal number of reference genes was three and RPL13A was found to be most stable. During cell culture a number of four reference genes were found to be optimal and YWHAZ was found to be the most stable gene. \u03b2-actin and GAPDH were found to be the least stable genes during culture.\nOverall we found that the validation of reference genes was important in order to normalize target gene expression correctly, and suggest sets of reference genes to be used under different experimental conditions, in order to quantify mRNA transcript levels in blood-brain barrier cell models correctly.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, BjABR1, an AP2\/ERF superfamily gene, from tuber mustard (Brassica juncea var. tumida Tsen et Lee), sharing high amino acid sequence similarity with the AtABR1 (Arabidopsis thaliana AP2-like abscisic acid repressor 1) gene, were performed functional research, and the ABR1 homologous genes in Brassica species were identified and performed phylogenetic analysis. The promoter sequence of BjABR1 contained many phytohormone- and stress-related cis-elements; ABA (abscisic acid) and abiotic stresses can induce BjABR1 expression in tuber mustard; overexpression of BjABR1 in Arabidopsis can alleviate plant sensitivity to ABA and salt and osmotic stresses, and the alleviation may be due to changes in stress\/ABA-induced gene expression. These results indicated that BjABR1 functions in ABA and abiotic stress responses. By BLAST searches against the genome database of five Brassica species (three diploids, B. rapa, B. nigra, and B. oleracea, and two allotetraploid, B. juncea and B. napus) using the protein sequence of AtABR1, 3, 3, 3, 6, and 5 ABR1 homologous genes in B. nigra, B. rapa, B. oleracea, B. juncea, and B. napus were identified, respectively, and they shared high sequence similarity. By sequence analysis, annotation mistakes of the protein-coding regions of two ABR1 homologous genes, GSBRNA2T00134741001 and BjuB007684, were found and corrected. Then, the evolution analysis of these ABR1 homologous genes showed that the ancestor of the three diploid species had three ABR1 homologous genes and each diploid inherited all the three genes from their ancestor; then, allotetraploid B. juncea inherited all the six genes from B. rapa and B. nigra with no gene lost, while allotetraploid B. napus inherited all the three genes from B. oleracea and two genes from B. rapa with one gene lost, indicating that ABR1 homologous genes possessed greater hereditary conservation in Brassica species. The ABR1 homologous genes between B. rapa and B. oleracea shared much higher sequence similarity compared to that of B. nigra in diploid species, indicating that ABR1 homologous genes in B. nigra had experienced more rapid evolution, and B. rapa and B. oleracea may share closer relationship compared to B. nigra. Moreover, the spatial and temporal expression analysis of six ABR1 homologous genes of tuber mustard showed that they possessed different expression models. These results imply that ABR1 homologous genes are important to Brassica plants, and they may possess similar function in ABA and abiotic stress responses but play a role in different tissues and growing stages of plant. This study will provide the foundation to the functional research of ABR1 homologous genes in the Brassica species and help to reveal and understand the evolution mechanisms of Brassica species.\n","328":"\nMost rice blast resistance genes (R-genes) encode proteins with nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. Our previous study has shown that more rice blast R-genes can be cloned in rapidly evolving NBS-LRR gene families. In the present study, two rapidly evolving R-gene families in rice were selected for cloning a subset of genes from their paralogs in three resistant rice lines. A total of eight functional blast R-genes were identified among nine NBS-LRR genes, and some of these showed resistance to three or more blast strains. Evolutionary analysis indicated that high nucleotide diversity of coding regions served as important parameters in the determination of gene resistance. We also observed that amino-acid variants (nonsynonymous mutations, insertions, or deletions) in essential motifs of the NBS domain contribute to the blast resistance capacity of NBS-LRR genes. These results suggested that the NBS regions might also play an important role in resistance specificity determination. On the other hand, different splicing patterns of introns were commonly observed in R-genes. The results of the present study contribute to improving the effectiveness of R-gene identification by using evolutionary analysis method and acquisition of novel blast resistance genes. \n","329":"\nSweet potato production is constrained by Fusarium wilt, which is caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. batatas (Fob). The identification of genes related to disease resistance and the underlying mechanisms will contribute to improving disease resistance via sweet potato breeding programs. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and digital gene expression (DGE) profiling of sweet potato challenged with Fob using Illumina HiSeq technology. In total, 89,944,188 clean reads were generated from 12 samples and assembled into 101,988 unigenes with an average length of 666 bp; of these unigenes, 62,605 (61.38%) were functionally annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database by BLASTX with a cutoff E-value of 10-5. Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations were examined to explore the unigenes' functions. We constructed four DGE libraries for the sweet potato cultivars JinShan57 (JS57, highly resistant) and XinZhongHua (XZH, highly susceptible), which were challenged with pathogenic Fob. Genes that were differentially expressed in the four libraries were identified by comparing the transcriptomes. Various genes that were differentially expressed during defense, including chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (CERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), WRKY, NAC, MYB, and ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF), as well as resistance genes, pathogenesis-related genes, and genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways, were identified.

Identifying potential prognostic markers of AITL may provide information regarding the development of precision medicine. Methods: RNA sequence data from PTCL and patient clinic traits were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed to identify DEGs between the different PTCL subtypes and investigate the relationship underlying co-expression modules and clinic traits. Gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses based on DAVID and the STRING website, respectively, were utilized to deeply excavate hub genes. Results: After removing the outliers from the GSE65823, GSE58445, GSE19069, and GSE6338 datasets using the results from an unsupervised cluster heatmap, 50 AITL samples and 55 anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) samples were screened. A total of 677 upregulated DEGs and 237 downregulated DEGs were identified in AITL and used to construct a PPI network complex. Using WGCNA, 12 identified co-expression modules were constructed from the 5468 genes with the top 10% of variance, and 192 genes from the Turquoise and Brown modules were with a Gene Significance (GS) cut-off threshold >0.6. Eleven hub genes (CDH1, LAT, LPAR1, CXCL13, CD27, ICAM2, CD3E, CCL19, CTLA-4, CXCR5, and C3) were identified. Only CTLA-4 overexpressed was found to be a poor prognostic factor according to survival analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified and validated the intersection of key pathways (T cell receptor, primary immunodeficiency, and chemokine signaling pathways). Conclusion: Our findings provide the framework for the identification of AITL co-expression gene modules and identify key pathways and driving genes that may be novel treatment targets and helpful for the development of a prognostic evaluation index.\n","331":"\nStudies on the transcriptional control of gene expression play an important role in many areas of biology. Reference genes, which are often referred to as housekeeping genes, such as GAPDH, G3PDH, EF2, RpL7A, RpL10, TUB\u03b1 and Actin, have traditionally been assumed to be stably expressed in all conditions, and they are frequently used to normalize mRNA levels between different samples in qPCR analysis. However, it is known that the expression of these genes is influenced by numerous factors, such as experimental conditions. The difference in gene expression underlies a range of biological processes, including development, reproduction and behavior. The aim of this study was to show the problems associated with using reference genes in the qPCR technique, in a study on inbred strains of Spodoptera exigua selected toward cadmium resistance. We present and discuss our results and observations, and give some recommendations concerning the use and limitations of housekeeping genes as internal standards, especially in research on insects.

Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), one of the main oil crops in China, shows higher sensitivity to boron (B) deficiency than other species. Here, we demonstrated AS changes that largely increased the diversity of the mRNA expressed in response to B deficiency in B. napus. Each gene had two or more transcripts on average. A total of 33.3% genes in both Qingyou10 (QY10, B-efficient cultivar) and Westar10 (W10, B-inefficient cultivar) showed AS in both B conditions. The types of AS events were mainly intron retention, 3' alternative splice site, 5' alternative splice site and exon skipping. The tolerance ability of QY10 was higher than that of W10, possibly because there were far more differential alternative splicing (DAS) genes identified in QY10 at low B conditions than in W10. The number of genes with both DAS and differentially expressed (DE) was far lower than that of the genes that were either with DAS or DE in QY10 and W10, suggesting that the DAS and DE genes were independent. Four Serine\/Arginine-rich (SR) splicing factors, BnaC06g14780D, BnaA01g14750D, BnaA06g15930D and BnaC01g41640D, underwent differentially alternative splicing in both cultivars. There existed gene\u207bgene interactions between BnaC06g14780D and the genes associated with the function of B in oilseed rape at low B supply. This suggests that oilseed rape could regulate the alterative pre-mRNA splicing of SR protein related genes to increase the plant tolerance to B deficiency.\n","333":"\nPlant NBS-LRR -resistance genes tend to be found in clusters, which have been shown to be hot spots of genome variability. In melon, half of the 81 predicted NBS-LRR genes group in nine clusters, and a 1\u00a0Mb region on linkage group V contains the highest density of R-genes and presence\/absence gene polymorphisms found in the melon genome. This region is known to contain the locus of Vat, an agronomically important gene that confers resistance to aphids. However, the presence of duplications makes the sequencing and annotation of R-gene clusters difficult, usually resulting in multi-gapped sequences with higher than average errors.\nA 1-Mb sequence that contains the largest NBS-LRR gene cluster found in melon was improved using a strategy that combines Illumina paired-end mapping and PCR-based gap closing. Unknown sequence was decreased by 70% while about 3,000 SNPs and small indels were corrected. As a result, the annotations of 18 of a total of 23 NBS-LRR genes found in this region were modified, including additional coding sequences, amino acid changes, correction of splicing boundaries, or fussion of ORFs in common transcription units. A phylogeny analysis of the R-genes and their comparison with syntenic sequences in other cucurbits point to a pattern of local gene amplifications since the diversification of cucurbits from other families, and through speciation within the family. A candidate Vat gene is proposed based on the sequence similarity between a reported Vat gene from a Korean melon cultivar and a sequence fragment previously absent in the unrefined sequence.\nA sequence refinement strategy allowed substantial improvement of a 1\u00a0Mb fragment of the melon genome and the re-annotation of the largest cluster of NBS-LRR gene homologues found in melon. Analysis of the cluster revealed that resistance genes have been produced by sequence duplication in adjacent genome locations since the divergence of cucurbits from other close families, and through the process of speciation within the family a candidate Vat gene was also identified using sequence previously unavailable, which demonstrates the advantages of genome assembly refinements when analyzing complex regions such as those containing clusters of highly similar genes.\n","334":"\nRAW264.7 is a macrophage strain derived from mice tumour and shows a significant ability in antigen uptake.

The primary aim of this study was to define which CD locus genes are most likely to be disease related. We developed a gene prioritization regression model (GPRM) by integrating complementary mRNA expression datasets, including bulk RNA-Seq from the terminal ileum of 302 newly diagnosed, untreated CD patients and controls, and in stimulated monocytes. Transcriptome-wide association and co-expression network analyses were performed on the ileal RNA-Seq datasets, identifying 40 genome-wide significant genes. Co-expression network analysis identified a single gene module, which was substantially enriched for CD locus genes and most highly expressed in monocytes. By including expression-based and epigenetic information, we refined likely CD genes to 2.5 prioritized genes per locus from an average of 7.8 total genes. We validated our model structure using cross-validation and our prioritization results by protein-association network analyses, which demonstrated significantly higher CD gene interactions for prioritized compared with non-prioritized genes. Although individual datasets cannot convey all of the information relevant to a disease, combining data from multiple relevant expression-based datasets improves prediction of disease genes and helps to further understanding of disease pathogenesis.\n","336":"\nPheochromocytoma\/paraganglioma (PCPG) is a benign neuroendocrine neoplasm in most cases, but metastasis and other malignant behaviors can be observed in this tumor.

Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV; genus Crinivirus, family Closteroviridae) is transmitted by the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) in a semipersistent manner and infects several globally important agricultural and ornamental crops, including tomato.\nTo determine changes in global gene regulation in whiteflies after feeding on tomato plants infected with a crinivirus (ToCV), comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed using RNA-Seq on whitefly (Bemisia tabaci MEAM1) populations after 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h acquisition access periods on either ToCV-infected or uninfected tomatoes. Significant differences in gene expression were detected between whiteflies fed on ToCV-infected tomato and those fed on uninfected tomato among the three feeding time periods: 447 up-regulated and 542 down-regulated at 24\u00a0h, 4 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated at 48\u00a0h, and 50 up-regulated and 160 down-regulated at 72\u00a0h. Analysis revealed differential regulation of genes associated with metabolic pathways, signal transduction, transport and catabolism, receptors, glucose transporters, \u03b1-glucosidases, and the uric acid pathway in whiteflies fed on ToCV-infected tomatoes, as well as an abundance of differentially regulated novel orphan genes. Results demonstrate for the first time, a specific and temporally regulated response by the whitefly to feeding on a host plant infected with a semipersistently transmitted virus, and advance the understanding of the whitefly vector-virus interactions that facilitate virus transmission.\nWhitefly transmission of semipersistent viruses is believed to require specific interactions between the virus and its vector that allow binding of virus particles to factors within whitefly mouthparts. Results provide a broader understanding of the potential mechanism of crinivirus transmission by whitefly, aid in discerning genes or loci in whitefly that influence virus interactions or transmission, and subsequently facilitate development of novel, genetics-based control methods against whitefly and whitefly-transmitted viruses.\n","338":"\nThe present study aimed to screen for potential genes and subnetworks associated with pancreatic cancer (PC) using the gene expression profile.

The results showed that these genes were closely related to lily bulb vernalization and development. Combining gene expression pattern with gene co-expression network, five genes (Contig5669, Contig13319, Contig7715, Contig1420 and Contig87292) were considered to be the most potential signals, and the sucrose transporter gene (SUT) was the focus of this study. Carbohydrate transport pathway and genes' regulation mechanism were inferred through a physiological and molecular test. SUT seemed to be the sugar sensor that could sense and regulate sugar concentration, which might have effects on other genes, such as FT, LFY and so on. LoSUT2 and LoSUT4 genes were cloned from Oriental hybrid lily 'Sorbonne' by RACE, which was the first time for these genes in Oriental hybrid lily 'Sorbonne'. The physiological properties of these proteins were analyzed such as hydrophobicity and phosphorylation. In addition, secondary and tertiary structures of proteins were predicted, which indicated the two proteins were membrane proteins. Their cellular locations were verified through positioning the experiment of the fluorescent vector. They were highly expressed in cells around phloem, which illustrated the key role of these genes in sugar transport. Furthermore, transient expression assays showed that overexpressed LoSUT2 and LoSUT4 in Arabidopsis thaliana bloomed significantly earlier than the wild type and the expression of FT, SOC1 and LFY were also affected by LoSUT2 and LoSUT4, which indicated that LoSUT2 and LoSUT4 may regulate plants flowering time.\n","340":"\nCotton plays an important role in the economy of many countries. Many studies have revealed that numerous genes and various metabolic pathways are involved in anther development. In this research, we studied the differently expressed mRNA and lncRNA during the anther development of cotton between the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) line, C2P5A, and the maintainer line, C2P5B, using RNA-seq analysis. We identified 17,897 known differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, and 865 DE long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that corresponded to 1172 cis-target genes at three stages of anther development using gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment of DE mRNAs; and cis-target genes of DE lncRNAs probably involved in the degradation of tapetum cells, microspore development, pollen development, and in the differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of the anther cell wall in cotton. Of these DE genes, LTCONS_00105434, LTCONS_00004262, LTCONS_00126105, LTCONS_00085561, and LTCONS_00085561, correspond to cis-target genes Ghir_A09G011050.1, Ghir_A01G005150.1, Ghir_D05G003710.2, Ghir_A03G016640.1, and Ghir_A12G005100.1, respectively. They participate in oxidative phosphorylation, flavonoid biosynthesis, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, fatty acid biosynthesis, and MAPK signaling pathway in plants, respectively. In summary, the transcriptomic data indicated that DE lncRNAs and DE mRNAs were related to the anther development of cotton at the pollen mother cell stage, tetrad stage, and microspore stage, and abnormal expression could lead to anther abortion, resulting in male sterility of cotton.\n","341":"\nDexamethasone-induced Ras-related protein 1 (Rasd1) is a member of the Ras superfamily of monomeric G proteins that have a regulatory function in signal transduction. Here we investigated the role of Rasd1 in regulating estrogen-induced gene expression in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. Rasd1 mRNA expression in anterior pituitary cells decreased after treatment with forskolin or serum and increased after treatment with 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2). Increases in Rasd1 mRNA expression occurred as early as 0.5 h after E2 treatment, peaked at 1 h and were sustained for as long as 96 h. This rapid and profound increase in Rasd1 mRNA expression induced by E2 was also seen in GH4C1 cells, an estrogen receptor-positive somatolactotroph cell line. Among pituitary estrogen-responsive late genes studied, basal mRNA expression of Pim3 and Igf1 genes was decreased by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Rasd1 expression, whereas basal expression of the Giot1 gene was increased. Moreover, Rasd1 knockdown enhanced stimulation of Pim3 mRNA expression and attenuated inhibition of Fosl1 mRNA expression 24 h after E2 treatment. These changes in mRNA expression were accompanied by enhanced activity of promoters containing CRE, AP-1 and SRE binding sequences. These results suggest that Rasd1 is an estrogen-responsive immediate early gene and modulates E2 induction of at least several late genes in anterior pituitary cells.\n","342":"\nThis study aimed to screen sensitive biomarkers for the efficacy evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.\nIn this study, Illumina digital gene expression sequencing technology was applied and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between patients presenting pathological complete response (pCR) and non-pathological complete response (NpCR) were identified. Further, gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were then performed. The genes in significant enriched pathways were finally quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to confirm that they were differentially expressed. Additionally, GSE23988 from Gene Expression Omnibus database was used as the validation dataset to confirm the DEGs.\nAfter removing the low-quality reads, 715 DEGs were finally detected. After mapping to KEGG pathways, 10 DEGs belonging to the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (HECTD3, PSMB10, UBD, UBE2C, and UBE2S) and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions (CCL2, CCR1, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IL2RG) were selected for further analysis. These 10 genes were finally quantified by qRT-PCR to confirm that they were differentially expressed (the log2 fold changes of selected genes were -\u20095.34, 7.81, 6.88, 5.74, 3.11, 19.58, 8.73, 8.88, 7.42, and 34.61 for HECTD3, PSMB10, UBD, UBE2C, UBE2S, CCL2, CCR1, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IL2RG, respectively). Moreover, 53 common genes were confirmed by the validation dataset, including downregulated UBE2C and UBE2S.\nOur results suggested that these 10 genes belonging to these two pathways might be useful as sensitive biomarkers for the efficacy evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.\n","343":"\nWithania somnifera (L.) Dunal is an important Indian medicinal plant that produces withanolides, which are triterpenoid steroidal lactones having diverse biological activities. To enable fast and efficient functional characterization of genes in this slow-growing and difficult-to-transform plant, a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was established by silencing phytoene desaturase (PDS) and squalene synthase (SQS). VIGS of the gene encoding SQS, which provides precursors for triterpenoids, resulted in significant reduction of squalene and withanolides, demonstrating its application in studying withanolides biosynthesis in W. somnifera leaves. A comprehensive analysis of gene expression and sterol pathway intermediates in WsSQS-vigs plants revealed transcriptional modulation with positive feedback regulation of mevalonate pathway genes, and negative feed-forward regulation of downstream sterol pathway genes including DWF1 (delta-24-sterol reductase) and CYP710A1 (C-22-sterol desaturase), resulting in significant reduction of sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol. However, there was little effect of SQS silencing on cholesterol, indicating the contribution of sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol, but not of cholesterol, towards withanolides formation. Branch-point oxidosqualene synthases in WsSQS-vigs plants exhibited differential regulation with reduced CAS (cycloartenol synthase) and cycloartenol, and induced BAS (\u03b2-amyrin synthase) and \u03b2-amyrin. Moreover, SQS silencing also led to the down-regulation of brassinosteroid-6-oxidase-2 (BR6OX2), pathogenesis-related (PR) and nonexpressor of PR (NPR) genes, resulting in reduced tolerance to bacterial and fungal infection as well as to insect feeding. Taken together, SQS silencing negatively regulated sterol and defence-related genes leading to reduced phytosterols, withanolides and biotic stress tolerance, thus implicating the application of VIGS for functional analysis of genes related to withanolides formation in W. somnifera leaves.\n\u00a9 2015 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n","344":"\nGene expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a very sensitive technique and its sensitivity depends on the stable performance of reference gene(s) used in the study. A number of housekeeping genes have been used in various expression studies in many crops however, their expression were found to be inconsistent under different stress conditions. As a result, species specific housekeeping genes have been recommended for different expression studies in several crop species. However, such specific housekeeping genes have not been reported in the case of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) despite the fact that genome sequence has become available for the crop. To identify the stable housekeeping genes in pigeonpea for expression analysis under drought stress conditions, the relative expression variations of 10 commonly used housekeeping genes (EF1\u03b1, UBQ10, GAPDH, 18SrRNA, 25SrRNA, TUB6, ACT1, IF4\u03b1, UBC and HSP90) were studied on root, stem and leaves tissues of Asha (ICPL 87119). Three statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper were used to define the stability of candidate genes. geNorm analysis identified IF4\u03b1 and TUB6 as the most stable housekeeping genes however, NormFinder analysis determined IF4\u03b1 and HSP90 as the most stable housekeeping genes under drought stress conditions. Subsequently validation of the identified candidate genes was undertaken in qRT-PCR based gene expression analysis of uspA gene which plays an important role for drought stress conditions in pigeonpea. The relative quantification of the uspA gene varied according to the internal controls (stable and least stable genes), thus highlighting the importance of the choice of as well as validation of internal controls in such experiments. The identified stable and validated housekeeping genes will facilitate gene expression studies in pigeonpea especially under drought stress conditions. \n","345":"\nResearchers often measure changes in gene expression across conditions to better understand the shared functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of different genes. Analogous to this is comparing gene expression across species, which can improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes shaping the evolution of both individual genes and functional pathways. One area of interest is determining genes showing signals of coevolution, which can also indicate potential functional similarity, analogous to co-expression analysis often performed across conditions for a single species. However, as with any trait, comparing gene expression across species can be confounded by the non-independence of species due to shared ancestry, making standard hypothesis testing inappropriate.\nWe compared RNA-Seq data across 18 fungal species using a multivariate Brownian Motion phylogenetic comparative method (PCM), which allowed us to quantify coevolution between protein pairs while directly accounting for the shared ancestry of the species. Our work indicates proteins which physically-interact show stronger signals of coevolution than randomly-generated pairs. Interactions with stronger empirical and computational evidence also showing stronger signals of coevolution. We examined the effects of number of protein interactions and gene expression levels on coevolution, finding both factors are overall poor predictors of the strength of coevolution between a protein pair. Simulations further demonstrate the potential issues of analyzing gene expression coevolution without accounting for shared ancestry in a standard hypothesis testing framework. Furthermore, our simulations indicate the use of a randomly-generated null distribution as a means of determining statistical significance for detecting coevolving genes with phylogenetically-uncorrected correlations, as has previously been done, is less accurate than PCMs, although is a significant improvement over standard hypothesis testing. These methods are further improved by using a phylogenetically-corrected correlation metric.\nOur work highlights potential benefits of using PCMs to detect gene expression coevolution from high-throughput omics scale data. This framework can be built upon to investigate other evolutionary hypotheses, such as changes in transcription regulatory mechanisms across species.\n","346":"\nGene elongation is a molecular mechanism consisting of an in-tandem duplication of a gene and divergence and fusion of the two copies, resulting in a gene constituted by two divergent paralogous modules. The aim of this work was to evaluate the importance of gene elongation in the evolution of histidine biosynthetic genes and to propose a possible evolutionary model for some of them. Concerning the genes hisA and hisF, which code for two homologous (\u03b2\/\u03b1)8-barrels, it has been proposed that the two extant genes could be the result of a cascade of gene elongation\/domain shuffling events starting from an ancestor gene coding for just one (\u03b2\/\u03b1) module. A gene elongation event has also been proposed for the evolution of hisB and hisD; structural analyses revealed the possibility of an early elongation event, resulting in the repetition of modules. Furthermore, it is quite possible that the gene elongations responsible for the evolution of the four proteins occurred before the earliest phylogenetic divergence. In conclusion, gene elongation events seem to have played a crucial role in the evolution of the histidine biosynthetic pathway, and they may have shaped the structures of many genes during the first steps of their evolution.\n","347":"\nWe explored genetic susceptibility profile of the South Indian women with a large set of SNPs and tested if the lack of association of type 2 diabetes genes with PCOS, recently observed in a number of studies, holds true for this Indian population and suggest probable universality of this phenomenon. A prioritized set of 92 SNPs that belong to important reproductive and metabolic pathway genes were genotyped on 250 PCOS cases and 299 ethnically matched controls, representing the southern Indian population of Hyderabad, using SEQUENOM MassARRAY iPLEX\u2122 platform. These data were analyzed both for individual SNP association patterns as well as for gene-gene interactions, besides obtaining cumulative risk score and the ROC curve with the help of appropriate statistical packages such as PLINK, SNPAssoc of R-program, Haploview, GMDR and SPSS. The analysis of 72 of the 92 SNPs, after excluding 20 of those that showed either minor allele frequency\u202f<\u202f1% and\/or deviated from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (p\u202f<\u202f.001), suggested that only 13 were associated with PCOS at p\u202f\u2264\u202f.05, but none after correction for multiple testing. Further, neither any of the diabetic genes nor the interactions between diabetic and reproductive pathway genes were found to be significant even at p\u202f\u2264\u202f.05.The lack of association of any of the SNPs with PCOS and\/or the gene-gene interactions among them may be because of the minor effects of each of them on the phenotype(OR\u202f<\u202f2). Further, that none of the type 2 diabetes genes were associated with PCOS in the present study as well as in the earlier studies from different ethnic groups may indicate probable universality of this pattern. It is possible that there are still other genetic variants, novel as well as already known, which may confer greater risk than the ones considered in this study and further studies are warranted to ascertain this both in the present population as well as in other ethnic and\/or geographic groups of the Indian subcontinent.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, in the past 20 years, considerable variability has existed in the study design and quality of evidence supporting reported gene-disease associations, raising concerns of the validity of many published disease-causing genes. Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an arrhythmia syndrome with a risk of sudden death. More than 20 genes have been reported to cause BrS and are assessed routinely on genetic testing panels in the absence of a systematic, evidence-based evaluation of the evidence supporting the causality of these genes.\nWe evaluated the clinical validity of genes tested by diagnostic laboratories for BrS by assembling 3 gene curation teams. Using an evidence-based semiquantitative scoring system of genetic and experimental evidence for gene-disease associations, curation teams independently classified genes as demonstrating limited, moderate, strong, or definitive evidence for disease causation in BrS. The classification of curator teams was reviewed by a clinical domain expert panel that could modify the classifications based on their independent review and consensus.\nOf 21 genes curated for clinical validity, biocurators classified only 1 gene ( SCN5A) as definitive evidence, whereas all other genes were classified as limited evidence. After comprehensive review by the clinical domain Expert panel, all 20 genes classified as limited evidence were reclassified as disputed with regard to any assertions of disease causality for BrS.\nOur results contest the clinical validity of all but 1 gene clinically tested and reported to be associated with BrS. These findings warrant a systematic, evidence-based evaluation for reported gene-disease associations before use in patient care.\n","349":"\nProteeae is a tribe which consists of three genera: Proteus, Providencia and Morganella. The objective of this study was to determine antimicrobial resistance profile, virulence genotype and class 1 and 2 integrons in Proteeae isolated from pet turtles and to determine the impact of antibiotic resistance on virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes. Integron-positive isolates were used to detect their gene cassette array. Sixty four Proteeae were isolated and all were resistant to macrolides (100%). Among 64 isolates 56, 52, 36 and 25 were resistant to nitrofurans, \u03b2-lactams, tetracycline and aminoglycoside respectively. Sixteen (25%) isolates were positive for intI1 while 14 (21\u00b787%) were positive for integrase 2 (intI2). Eleven (17\u00b718%) isolates were positive for class 1 variable region while 7 (10\u00b793%) were positive for class 2 variable region. IMP27, a novel metallo \u03b2-lactamase gene was found in Providencia isolates. Proteus sp. were positive for every tested virulence genes and UreC gene was detected in 48\u00b744% followed by zapA (17\u00b719%), mrpA (17\u00b719%) and hlyA (14\u00b706%) genes. In this study, integron associated-antibiotic resistance genes have been identified in Proteeae isolates in a considerable range representing clear threats to public health. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study, multidrug-resistant Proteeae isolates had several antibiotic resistance genes. Integrons are important contributors to the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance. We could detect both class 1 and 2 integrons and several gene cassette arrays in class 1 integron. The gene cassette arrays of the Class 2 integrons contained IMP27-dfrA1-aadA1-catB2-ybeA-ybgA in two isolates. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report detection of IMP27 in Providencia rettgeri isolates.

WRKY transcription factor genes play crucial roles in the growth, development, and stress responses of plants. However, the WRKY gene family has not been characterised in P. mume. There were 58 PmWRKYs identified from genome of P. mume. They were anchored onto eight link groups and categorised into three broad groups. The gene structure and motif composition were reasonably conservative in each group. Investigation of gene duplication indicated that nine and seven PmWRKYs were arranged in tandem and segmental duplications, respectively. PmWRKYs were discriminately expressed in different tissues (i.e., roots, stems, leaves, \ufb02owers and fruits) in P. mume. The 17 cold-related candidate genes were selected based on RNA-seq data. Further, to investigate the function of PmWRKYs in low temperatures, the expression patterns under artificial cold treatments were analysed. The results showed that the expression levels of the 12 PmWRKYs genes significantly and 5 genes slightly changed in stems. In particular, the expression level of PmWRKY18 was up-regulated after ABA treatment. In addition, the spatiotemporal expression patterns of 17 PmWRKYs were analysed in winter. These results indicated that 17 PmWRKYs were potential transcription factors regulating cold resistance in P. mume.\n","351":"\nMultigene panels provide a powerful tool for analyzing several genes simultaneously. We evaluated the frequency of pathogenic variants (PV) in customized predefined panels according to clinical suspicion by phenotype and compared it to the yield obtained in the analysis of our clinical research gene panel. We also investigated mutational yield of opportunistic testing of BRCA1\/2 and mismatch repair (MMR) genes in all patients. A total of 1,205 unrelated probands with clinical suspicion of hereditary cancer were screened for germline mutations using panel testing. Overall, 1,048 females and 157 males were analyzed, mean age at cancer diagnosis was 48; 883 had hereditary breast\/ovarian cancer-suspicion, 205 hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)-suspicion, 73 adenomatous-polyposis-suspicion and 44 with other\/multiple clinical criteria. At least one PV was found in 150 probands (12%) analyzed by our customized phenotype-driven panel. Tumoral MMR deficiency predicted for the presence of germline MMR gene mutations in patients with HNPCC-suspicion (46\/136 vs. 0\/56 in patients with and without MMR deficiency, respectively). Opportunistic testing additionally identified five MSH6, one BRCA1 and one BRCA2 carriers (0.6%). The analysis of the extended 24-gene panel provided 25 additional PVs (2%), including in 4 out of 51 individuals harboring MMR-proficient colorectal tumors (2 CHEK2 and 2 ATM). Phenotype-based panels provide a notable rate of PVs with clinical actionability. Opportunistic testing of MMR and BRCA genes leads to a significant straightforward identification of MSH6, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, and endorses the model of opportunistic testing of genes with clinical utility within a standard genetic counseling framework.\n\u00a9 2019 UICC.\n","352":"\nPreeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria of gestation, with serious consequences for mother and infant. Although a vast amount of research has been performed on the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, the underlying mechanisms of this multisystemic disease have remained to be fully elucidated. Data were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus database GSE40182 dataset. After data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes of placental cells cultured in vitro from preeclampsia and normal pregnancy were determined and subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis to identify the associated pathways. Furthermore, functional principal component analysis (FPCA) was used to calculate the corresponding F-value of each gene. In order to further study the key signaling pathways of preeclampsia, an elastic-net regression model and the Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test were used to estimate the weight of the signaling pathways. Finally, a co-expression network was generated and hub genes were identified based on the topological features. A total of 134 pathways with a role in preeclampsia were identified. The gene expression data of placenta cells cultured in vitro for different durations were determined and F-values of genes were estimated using the FPCA model. The top 1,000 genes were identified as the differentially expressed genes and subjected to further analysis by elastic-net regression and MWU test. Two key signaling pathways were different between the preeclampsia and control groups, namely hsa05142 Chagas disease and hsa05204 Chemical carcinogenesis. Among the genes involved in these two key pathways, 13 hub genes were identified from the co-expression network. Clustering analysis demonstrated that depending on these hub genes, it was possible to divide the sample into four distinct groups based on different incubation time. The top 3 candidates were Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13). TLR2 and associated pathways are known to be closely associated with preeclampsia, indirectly demonstrating the applicability of the analytic process applied. However, the role of GSTO1 and MAPK13 in preeclampsia has remained poorly investigated, and elucidation thereof may be a worthwhile endeavor. The present study may provide a basis for exploring potential novel genes and pathways as therapeutic targets for preeclampsia.\n","353":"\nIt has been difficult to elucidate the structure of gene regulatory networks under anticancer drug treatment. Here, we developed an algorithm to highlight the hub genes that play a major role in creating the upstream and downstream relationships within a given set of differentially expressed genes. The directionality of the relationships between genes was defined using information from comprehensive collections of transcriptome profiles after gene knockdown and overexpression. As expected, among the drug-perturbed genes, our algorithm tended to derive plausible hub genes, such as transcription factors. Our validation experiments successfully showed the anticipated activity of certain hub gene in establishing the gene regulatory network that was associated with cell growth inhibition. Notably, giving such top priority to the hub gene was not achieved by ranking fold change in expression and by the conventional gene set enrichment analysis of drug-induced transcriptome data. Thus, our data-driven approach can facilitate to understand drug-induced gene regulatory networks for finding potential functional genes.\n","354":"\nGene expression analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is routinely used in biomedical studies. The reproducibility and reliability of the data fundamentally depends on experimental design and data interpretation. Despite the wide application of this assay, there is significant variation in the validation process of gene expression data from research laboratories. Since the validity of results depends on appropriate normalisation, it is crucial to select appropriate reference gene(s), where transcription of the selected gene is unaffected by experimental setting. In this study we have applied geNorm technology to investigate the transcription of 12 'housekeeping' genes for use in the normalisation of RT-qPCR data acquired using a widely accepted HepaRG hepatic cell line in studies examining models of pre-clinical drug testing. geNorm data identified a number of genes unaffected by specific drug treatments and showed that different genes remained invariant in response to different drug treatments, whereas the transcription of 'classical' reference genes such as GAPDH (glyceralde- hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was altered by drug treatment. Comparing data normalised using the reference genes identified by geNorm with normalisation using classical housekeeping genes demonstrated substantial differences in the final results. In light of cell therapy application, RT-qPCR analyses has to be carefully evaluated to accurately interpret data obtained from dynamic cellular models undergoing sequential stages of phenotypic change.\n","355":"\nDespite advances in characterizing the neurobiology of emotional disorders, there is still a significant lack of scientific understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms governing major depressive disorder (MDD). This study attempted to elucidate the molecular circuitry of MDD and to identify more potential genes associated with the pathogenesis of the disease.\nMicroarray data from the GSE98793 dataset were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including 128 patients with MDD and 64 healthy controls. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to find modules of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with high correlations followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses to obtain further biological insight into the top three key modules. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, the modules from the PPI network, and the gene annotation enrichment of modules were analyzed, as well.\nWe filtered 3276 genes that were considered significant DEGs for further WGCNA analysis. By performing WGCNA, we found that the turquoise, blue and brown functional modules were all strongly correlated with MDD development, including immune response, neutrophil degranulation, ribosome biogenesis, T cell activation, glycosaminoglycan biosynthetic process, and protein serine\/threonine kinase activator activity. Hub genes were identified in the key functional modules that might have a role in the progression of MDD. Functional annotation showed that these modules primarily enriched such KEGG pathways as the TNF signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, primary immunodeficiency, Th1, Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation, autophagy and RNA degradation and oxidative phosphorylation. These results suggest that these genes are closely related to autophagy and cellular immune function.\nThe results of this study may help to elucidate the pathophysiology of MDD development at the molecular level and explore the potential molecular mechanisms for new interventional strategies.\n\u00a9 2020 Zhang et al.\n","356":"\nBicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality and predisposes patients to life-threatening aortic complications including aortic aneurysm. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most commonly used methods to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms involved in aortopathy. The accuracy of the gene expression data is dependent on normalization by appropriate housekeeping (HK) genes, whose expression should remain constant regardless of aortic valve morphology, aortic diameter and other factors associated with aortopathy. Here, we identified an appropriate set of HK genes to be used as endogenous reference for quantifying gene expression in ascending aortic tissue using a spin column-based RNA extraction method. Ascending aortic biopsies were collected intra-operatively from patients undergoing aortic valve and\/or ascending aortic surgery. These patients had BAV or tricuspid aortic valve (TAV), and the aortas were either dilated (\u22654.5cm) or undilated. The cohort had an even distribution of gender, valve disease and hypertension. The expression stability of 12 reference genes were investigated (ATP5B, ACTB, B2M, CYC1, EIF4A2, GAPDH, SDHA, RPL13A, TOP1, UBC, YWHAZ, and 18S) using geNorm software. The most stable HK genes were found to be GAPDH, UBC and ACTB. Both GAPDH and UBC demonstrated relative stability regardless of valve morphology, aortic diameter, gender and age. The expression of B2M and SDHA were found to be the least stable HK genes. We propose the use of GAPDH, UBC and ACTB as reference genes for gene expression studies of BAV aortopathy using ascending aortic tissue.\n","357":"\nNon-synonymous SNPs and protein coding SNPs within the promoter region of genes (regulatory SNPs) might have a significant effect on carcass traits. Imputed sequence level data of 10,215 Hanwoo bulls, annotated and filtered to include only regulatory SNPs (450,062 SNPs), were used in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci associated with backfat thickness (BFT), carcass weight (CWT), eye muscle area (EMA), and marbling score (MS). A total of 15, 176, and 1 SNPs were found to be significantly associated (p < 1.11 \u00d7 10-7) with BFT, CWT, and EMA, respectively. The significant loci were BTA4 (CWT), BTA6 (CWT), BTA14 (CWT and EMA), and BTA19 (BFT). BayesR estimated that 1.1%~1.9% of the SNPs contributed to more than 0.01% of the phenotypic variance. So, the GWAS was complemented by a gene-set enrichment (GSEA) and protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis in identifying the pathways affecting carcass traits. At p < 0.005 (~2,261 SNPs), 25 GO and 18 KEGG categories, including calcium signaling, cell proliferation, and folate biosynthesis, were found to be enriched through GSEA. The PPIN analysis showed enrichment for 81 candidate genes involved in various pathways, including the PI3K-AKT, calcium, and FoxO signaling pathways. Our finding provides insight into the effects of regulatory SNPs on carcass traits.\n","358":"\nSome mammalian reference genes, which are widely used to normalize the qRT-PCR, could not be used for this purpose due to its high expression variation. The normalization with false reference genes leads to misinterpretation of results.

Furthermore, many studies on silversides have used reference genes without previous validations. Thus, present study aimed to was to clone and sequence potential reference genes, thereby identifying the best ones in Odontesthes humensis considering different tissues, ages and conditions. For this purpose, animals belonging to three ages (adults, juveniles, and immature) were exposed to control, Roundup\u00ae, and seawater treatments for 24 h. Blood samples were subjected to flow-cytometry and other collected tissues to RNA extraction; cDNA synthesis; molecular cloning; DNA sequencing; and qRT-PCR. The candidate genes tested included 18s, actb, ef1a, eif3g, gapdh, h3a, atp1a, and tuba. Gene expression results were analyzed using five algorithms that ranked the candidate genes. The flow-cytometry data showed that the environmental challenges could trigger a systemic response in the treated fish. Even during this systemic physiological disorder, the consensus analysis of gene expression revealed h3a to be the most stable gene expression when only the treatments were considered. On the other hand, tuba was the least stable gene in the control and gapdh was the least stable in both Roundup\u00ae and seawater groups. In conclusion, the consensus analyses of different tissues, ages, and treatments groups revealed that h3a is the most stable gene whereas gapdh and tuba are the least stable genes, even being considered two constitutive genes.\n","359":"\nIncreasing the content of oleic acid in peanut seeds is one of the major goals in peanut breeding due to consumer and industry benefits, such as anti-oxidation and long shelf-life. Homeologous ahFAD2A and ahFAD2B genes encode fatty acid desaturases, which are the key enzymes for converting oleic acid to linoleic acid that oxidizes readily. To date, all high oleic acid peanut varieties result from natural mutations occurred in both genes. A method to induce mutations in the genes of other elite cultivars could speed introgression of this valuable trait. The gene-editing approach utilizing CRISPR\/Cas9 technology was employed to induce de novo mutations in the ahFAD2 genes using peanut protoplasts and hairy root cultures as models.\nThe hot spot of natural mutation in these genes was selected as the target region. Appropriate sgRNAs were designed and cloned into a CRISPR\/Cas9 expression plasmid. As a result of CRISPR\/Cas9 activity, three mutations were identified - G448A in ahFAD2A, and 441_442insA and G451T in ahFAD2B. The G448A and 441_442insA mutations are the same as those seen in existing high oleate varieties and the G451T is new mutation. Because natural mutations appear more often in the ahFAD2A gene than in the ahFAD2B gene in subspecies A. hypogaea var. hypogaea, the mutations induced in ahFAD2B by gene editing may be useful in developing high oleate lines with many genetic backgrounds after validation of oleic acid content in the transformed lines. The appearance of the G448A mutation in ahFAD2A is a further benefit for high oleic acid oil content.\nOverall, these results showed that mutations were, for the first time, induced by CRISPR-based gene editing approach in peanut. This research demonstrated the potential application of gene editing for mutagenesis in peanut and suggested that CRISPR\/Cas9 technology may be useful in the peanut breeding programs.\n","360":"\nTo analyze colorectal carcinogenesis and age-related DNA methylation alterations of gene sequences associated with epigenetic clock CpG sites.\nIn silico DNA methylation analysis of 353 epigenetic clock CpG sites published by Steve Horvath was performed using methylation array data for a set of 123 colonic tissue samples [64 colorectal cancer (CRC), 42 adenoma, 17 normal; GEO accession number: GSE48684]. Among the differentially methylated age-related genes, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1) promoter methylation was further investigated in colonic tissue from 8 healthy adults, 19 normal children, 20 adenoma and 8 CRC patients using bisulfite-specific PCR followed by methylation-specific high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis. mRNA expression of age-related \"epigenetic clock\" genes was studied using Affymetrix HGU133 Plus2.0 whole transcriptome data of 153 colonic biopsy samples (49 healthy adult, 49 adenoma, 49 CRC, 6 healthy children) (GEO accession numbers: GSE37364, GSE10714, GSE4183, GSE37267). Whole promoter methylation analysis of genes showing inverse DNA methylation-gene expression data was performed on 30 colonic samples using methyl capture sequencing.\nFifty-seven age-related CpG sites including hypermethylated PPP1R16B, SFRP1, SYNE1 and hypomethylated MGP, PIPOX were differentially methylated between CRC and normal tissues (P < 0.05, \u0394\u03b2 \u2265 10%). In the adenoma vs normal comparison, 70 CpG sites differed significantly, including hypermethylated DKK3, SDC2, SFRP1, SYNE1 and hypomethylated CEMIP, SPATA18 (P < 0.05, \u0394\u03b2 \u2265 10%). In MS-HRM analysis, the SFRP1 promoter region was significantly hypermethylated in CRC (55.0% \u00b1 8.4 %) and adenoma tissue samples (49.9% \u00b1 18.1%) compared to normal adult (5.2% \u00b1 2.7%) and young (2.2% \u00b1 0.7%) colonic tissue (P < 0.0001). DNA methylation of SFRP1 promoter was slightly, but significantly increased in healthy adults compared to normal young samples (P < 0.02). This correlated with significantly increased SFRP1 mRNA levels in children compared to normal adult samples (P < 0.05). In CRC tissue the mRNA expression of 117 age-related genes were changed, while in adenoma samples 102 genes showed differential expression compared with normal colonic tissue (P < 0.05, logFC > 0.5). The change of expression for several genes including SYNE1, CLEC3B, LTBP3 and SFRP1, followed the same pattern in aging and carcinogenesis, though not for all genes (e.g., MGP).\nSeveral age-related DNA methylation alterations can be observed during CRC development and progression affecting the mRNA expression of certain CRC- and adenoma-related key control genes.\n","361":"\nCancer is caused by malfunctioning of genes that normally regulate cardinal processes including various nuclear functions, cell division and survival, cell surface to nucleus signaling cascades, etc. Cancer associated genes are often classified as oncogenes (OCGs) or tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) depending on whether they promote or suppress tumorigenesis, respectively. Such strict classification of cancer genes may however be an over-simplification. Several studies have highlighted a dual role for cancer genes, often impacting the same facet of tumorigenesis. Knowledge of a possible dichotomy of a cancer gene (particularly an OCG) is imperative when evaluating its possible utility as a therapeutic target. Though previous studies have extensively evaluated specific examples of cancer genes exhibiting a dual nature, efforts to unravel the molecular basis for such contrasting functions have been fewer. The current review is an attempt to delineate molecular events underlying the functional dichotomy of cancer genes at the DNA (mutations, gene fusions, etc.), RNA (alternative splicing, regulation through non-coding RNAs, etc.) and protein (isoforms, mis-localisation, post-translational modifications, proteolytic cleavage, etc.) levels.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, enchondromas are always undetected in patients, and the molecular mechanism is unclear. To identify key genes and pathways associated with the occurrence and development of enchondromas, we downloaded the gene expression dataset GSE22855 and obtained the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by analyzing high-throughput gene expression in enchondromas. In total, 635 genes were identified as DEGs. Of these, 225 genes (35.43%) were up-regulated, and the remaining 410 genes (64.57%) were down-regulated. We identified the predominant gene ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that were significantly over-represented in the enchondromas samples compared with the control samples. Subsequently the top 10 core genes were identified from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The enrichment analyses of the genes mainly involved in two significant modules showed that the DEGs were principally related to ribosomes, protein digestion and absorption, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, amoebiasis and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.Together, these data elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the occurrence and development of enchondromas and provide promising candidates for therapeutic intervention and prognostic evaluation. However, further experimental studies are needed to confirm these results.\n","363":"\nTo improve the epigenomic analysis of tissues rich in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), we developed a novel protocol called TAB-Methyl-SEQ, which allows for single base resolution profiling of both hmC and 5-methylcytosine by targeted next-generation sequencing. TAB-Methyl-SEQ data were extensively validated by a set of five methodologically different protocols. Importantly, these extensive cross-comparisons revealed that protocols based on Tet1-assisted bisulfite conversion provided more precise hmC values than TrueMethyl-based methods. A total of 109 454 CpG sites were analyzed by TAB-Methyl-SEQ for mC and hmC in 188 genes from 20 different adult human livers. We describe three types of variability of hepatic hmC profiles: (i) sample-specific variability at 40.8% of CpG sites analyzed, where the local hmC values correlate to the global hmC content of livers (measured by LC-MS), (ii) gene-specific variability, where hmC levels in the coding regions positively correlate to expression of the respective gene and (iii) site-specific variability, where prominent hmC peaks span only 1 to 3 neighboring CpG sites. Our data suggest that both the gene- and site-specific components of hmC variability might contribute to the epigenetic control of hepatic genes. The protocol described here should be useful for targeted DNA analysis in a variety of applications.\n\u00a9 The Author 2016.

One cluster contains the genes FOXQ1, FOXF2, FOXC1 and the second consists of FOXF1, FOXC2, and FOXL1. In jawed vertebrates these genes are known to be expressed in different pharyngeal tissues and all, except FoxQ1, are involved in patterning the early embryonic mesoderm. We have previously traced the evolution of this cluster in the bony vertebrates, and the gene content is identical in the dogfish, a member of the most basally branching lineage of the jawed vertebrates. Here we extend these analyses to jawless vertebrates. Using genomic searches and molecular approaches we have identified homologues of these genes from lampreys. We identify two FoxC genes, two FoxF genes, two FoxQ1 genes and single FoxL1 gene. We examine the embryonic expression of one predominantly mesodermally expressed gene family, FoxC, and the endodermally expressed member of the cluster, FoxQ1. We identified FoxQ1 transcripts in the pharyngeal endoderm, while the two FoxC genes are differentially expressed in the pharyngeal mesenchyme and ectoderm. Furthermore we identify conserved expression of lamprey FoxC genes in the paraxial and intermediate mesoderms. We interpret our results through a chordate-wide comparison of expression patterns and discuss gene content in the context of theories on the evolution of the vertebrate genome.\n2011 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in cellular signalling is most commonly studied using the method Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Stable reference genes must be used to accurately quantify target transcript expression. The study aim was to identify suitable reference genes for normalisation of gene expression levels in normal dermal fibroblasts irradiated with either proton or photon beams. The online tool RefFinder was used to analyse and identify the most stably expressed genes from a panel of 22 gene candidates. To assess the reliability of the identified reference genes, a selection of the most and least stable reference genes was used to normalise target transcripts of interest. Fold change levels varied considerably depending on the used reference gene. The top ranked genes IPO8, PUM1, MRPL19 and PSMC4 produced highly similar target gene expression, while expression using the worst ranked genes, TFRC and HPRT1, was clearly modified due to reference gene instability.\n","366":"\nIn cancer, mutations of DNA methylation modification genes have crucial roles for epigenetic modifications genome-wide, which lead to the activation or suppression of important genes including tumor suppressor genes. Mutations on the epigenetic modifiers could affect the enzyme activity, which would result in the difference in genome-wide methylation profiles and, activation of downstream genes. Therefore, we investigated the effect of mutations on DNA methylation modification genes such as DNMT1, DNMT3A, MBD1, MBD4, TET1, TET2 and TET3 through a pan-cancer analysis.\nFirst, we investigated the effect of mutations in DNA methylation modification genes on genome-wide methylation profiles. We collected 3,644 samples that have both of mRNA and methylation data from 12 major cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The samples were divided into two groups according to the mutational signature. Differentially methylated regions (DMR) that overlapped with the promoter region were selected using minfi and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified using EBSeq. By integrating the DMR and DEG results, we constructed a comprehensive DNA methylome profiles on a pan-cancer scale. Second, we investigated the effect of DNA methylations in the promoter regions on downstream genes by comparing the two groups of samples in 11 cancer types. To investigate the effects of promoter methylation on downstream gene activations, we performed clustering analysis of DEGs. Among the DEGs, we selected highly correlated gene set that had differentially methylated promoter regions using graph based sub-network clustering methods.\nWe chose an up-regulated DEGs cluster where had hypomethylated promoter in acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) and another down-regulated DEGs cluster where had hypermethylated promoter in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). To rule out effects of gene regulation by transcription factor (TF), if differentially expressed TFs bound to the promoter of DEGs, that DEGs did not included to the gene set that effected by DNA methylation modifiers. Consequently, we identified 54 hypomethylated promoter DMR up-regulated DEGs in LAML and 45 hypermethylated promoter DMR down-regulated DEGs in COAD.\nOur study on DNA methylation modification genes in mutated vs. non-mutated groups could provide useful insight into the epigenetic regulation of DEGs in cancer.\n","367":"\nConidiation capacity and conidial quality are very important for the production and application of mycopesticides. Most filamentous ascomycetous fungi have two distinct patterns of conidiation. Conidiation through microcycle conidiation proceeds to more rapidly achieve a maximum of conidial yield than normal conidiation and hence is of greater merit for exploitation in mass production of fungal insect pathogens, such as Metarhizium acridum. In this study, the mechanism underlying the conidiation pattern shift in M. acridum was explored by characterization of the fungal homeobox gene MaH1. MaH1 was evidently localized to the nuclei of hyphae and transcriptionally expressed at a maximal level when conidiation began. Intriguingly, deletion of MaH1 in M. acridum resulted in a shift of normal conidiation to microcycle conidiation on one-quarter strength Sabouraud's dextrose agar medium, and hence accelerated conidiation and increased conidial yield. In the deletion mutant, moreover, conidia became larger in size and hyphae cells were shorter in length while conidial virulence and stress tolerance were not altered. As revealed by digital gene expression profiling, MaH1 controlled the shift of conidiation patterns by mediating transcription of a set of genes related to hyphal growth, cell differentiation, conidiation, and some important signaling pathways. These findings indicate that MaH1 and its downstream genes can be exploited to increase the conidial yield for more efficient production of mycopesticides.\n","368":"\nThe naturally colorful fur of the Rex rabbit is becoming increasingly popular in the modern textile market. Our previous study found that POU class 2 homeobox 1 gene (POU2F1) potentially affects the expression of genes involved in fur color formation in the Rex rabbit, but the function and regulation of POU2F1 has not been reported. In this study, the expression patterns of POU2F1 in Rex rabbits of various colors, as well as in different organs, were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Interference and overexpression of POU2F1 were used to identify the potential effects of POU2F1 on other genes related to fur color formation. The results show that the levels of POU2F1 expression were significantly higher in the dorsal skin of the brown and protein yellow Rex rabbits, compared with that of the black one. POU2F1 mRNAs were widespread in the tissues examined in this study and showed the highest level in the lungs. By transfecting rabbit melanocytes with an POU2F1-overexpression plasmid, we found that the POU2F1 protein was located at the nucleus, and the protein showed the classic characteristics of a transcription factor. In addition, abnormal expression of POU2F1 significantly affected the expression of pigmentation-related genes, including SLC7A11, MITF, SLC24A5, MC1R, and ASIP, revealing the regulatory roles of POU2F1 on pigmentation. The results provide the basis for further exploration of the role of POU2F1 in fur color formation of the Rex rabbit.\n","369":"\nColon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Due to the poor clinical outcomes, it is indispensable to investigate novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of COAD. The aim of this study is to explore key genes as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of COAD for clinical utility. Gene expression profiles (GSE44076 and GSE44861) and gene methylation profile (GSE29490) were analyzed to identify the aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes by R language and Perl software. Function enrichments were performed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. Moreover, hub genes were identified through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Besides, key genes were found by the module analysis and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) survival analysis. Finally, TCGA data and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to validate the key genes involved in COAD. Our study found two hypomethylation-high-expression genes (CXCL3 and CXCL8) in COAD tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. These results were also confirmed by RT-qPCR with 25 pairs of COAD and adjacent normal tissues. Meanwhile, low expression of the two genes was associated with poor survival in patients with COAD. CXCL3 and CXCL8 may serve as key genes in the diagnosis and prognosis for COAD.\n\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","370":"\nHeliconius possess a unique ability among butterflies to feed on pollen. Pollen feeding significantly extends their lifespan, and is thought to have been important to the diversification of the genus. We used RNA sequencing to examine feeding-related gene expression in the mouthparts of four species of Heliconius and one nonpollen feeding species, Eueides isabella We hypothesized that genes involved in morphology and protein metabolism might be upregulated in Heliconius because they have longer proboscides than Eueides, and because pollen contains more protein than nectar. Using de novo transcriptome assemblies, we tested these hypotheses by comparing gene expression in mouthparts against antennae and legs. We first looked for genes upregulated in mouthparts across all five species and discovered several hundred genes, many of which had functional annotations involving metabolism of proteins (cocoonase), lipids, and carbohydrates. We then looked specifically within Heliconius where we found eleven common upregulated genes with roles in morphology (CPR cuticle proteins), behavior (takeout-like), and metabolism (luciferase-like). Closer examination of these candidates revealed that cocoonase underwent several duplications along the lineage leading to heliconiine butterflies, including two Heliconius-specific duplications. Luciferase-like genes also underwent duplication within lepidopterans, and upregulation in Heliconius mouthparts. Reverse-transcription PCR confirmed that three cocoonases, a peptidase, and one luciferase-like gene are expressed in the proboscis with little to no expression in labial palps and salivary glands. Our results suggest pollen feeding, like other dietary specializations, was likely facilitated by adaptive expansions of preexisting genes-and that the butterfly proboscis is involved in digestive enzyme production.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2016.

The immediate early genes are considered the earliest nuclear targets of IR and are induced in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. Many of these genes encode transcription factors that constitute the first step in signal transduction to couple cytoplasmic effects with long-term cellular response. In this paper, coordinated transcript response of fos and jun family members which constitute activator protein 1 transcription factor was studied in response to IR in human peripheral blood lymphocytes at the G0 stage. Gene expression was monitored 5\u00a0min, 1\u00a0h and 4\u00a0h post-irradiation with Co60 \u03b3-rays (dose rate of 0.417\u00a0Gy\/min) and compared with sham-irradiated controls. When gene expression was analyzed at the early time point of 5\u00a0min post-irradiation with 0.3\u00a0Gy, the studied samples showed two distinct trends. Six out of ten individuals (called 'Group I responders') showed transient, but significant up-regulation for fosB, fosL1, fosL2 and c-jun with an average fold change (FC) \u22651.5 as compared to sham-irradiated controls. The Students's t test p value for all four genes was \u22640.001, indicating strong up-regulation. The remaining four individuals (called Group II responders) showed down-regulation for these same four genes. The average FC with 0.3\u00a0Gy in Group II individuals was 0.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) for fosB, 0.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) for fosL1, 0.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) for fosL2 and 0.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) for c-jun. The two groups could be clearly distinguished at this dose\/time point using principal component analysis. Both Group I and Group II responders did not show any change in expression for three genes (c-fos, junB and junD) as compared to sham-irradiated controls. Though a similar trend was seen 5\u00a0min post-irradiation with a relatively high dose of 1\u00a0Gy, the average FC was lower and change in gene expression was not statistically significant (at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), except for the down-regulation at fosL2 for Group II individuals (mean FC\u00a0=\u00a00.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Both groups of individuals did not show any differential change in expression (FC\u00a0~\u00a01.0) for most loci at the late time points of 1 and 4\u00a0h, neither with 0.3\u00a0Gy nor with 1\u00a0Gy.\n","372":"\nClassifying pathogenicity of missense variants represents a major challenge in clinical practice during the diagnoses of rare and genetic heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). While orthologous gene conservation is commonly employed in variant annotation, approximately 80% of known disease-associated genes belong to gene families. The use of gene family information for disease gene discovery and variant interpretation has not yet been investigated on a genome-wide scale. We empirically evaluate whether paralog-conserved or non-conserved sites in human gene families are important in NDDs.\nGene family information was collected from Ensembl. Paralog-conserved sites were defined based on paralog sequence alignments; 10,068 NDD patients and 2078 controls were statistically evaluated for de novo variant burden in gene families.\nWe demonstrate that disease-associated missense variants are enriched at paralog-conserved sites across all disease groups and inheritance models tested. We developed a gene family de novo enrichment framework that identified 43 exome-wide enriched gene families including 98 de novo variant carrying genes in NDD patients of which 28 represent novel candidate genes for NDD which are brain expressed and under evolutionary constraint.\nThis study represents the first method to incorporate gene family information into a statistical framework to interpret variant data for NDDs and to discover new NDD-associated genes.\n","373":"\nIn pituitary adenoma (PA), invasiveness is the main cause of recurrence and poor prognosis. Thus, identifying specific biomarkers for diagnosis and effective treatment of invasive PAs is of great clinical significance.

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to construct a scale-free topology model and analyze the relationships between the modules and clinical traits. Our analysis results indicated that three key modules (dark turquoise, saddle brown, and steel blue) were associated with the invasiveness of PA. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis and Gene Ontology analysis were performed for the functional annotation of the key modules. In addition, the hub genes in the three modules were identified and screened by differential expression analysis between normal samples and PA samples. Three upregulated differentially expressed genes (DGAT2, PIGZ, and DHRS2) were identified. The Fisher's exact test and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to validate the capability of these genes to distinguish invasive traits, and transcription factor interaction networks were used to further explore the underlying mechanisms of the three genes. Moreover, a lower expression level of DGAT2 in invasive PA tissue than in noninvasive PA tissue was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In general, this study contributes to potential molecular biomarkers of invasive PAs and provides a broader perspective for diagnosis and new therapeutic targets for the invasive PAs.\n","374":"\nCarotenoids are a class of terpenoid pigments that contribute to the color and nutritional value of many fruits. Their biosynthetic pathways have been well established in a number of plant species; however, many details of the regulatory mechanism controlling carotenoid metabolism remain to be elucidated. Apricot is one of the most carotenoid-rich fruits, making it a valuable system for investigating carotenoid metabolism. The purpose of this study was to identify key genes and regulators associated with carotenoid metabolism in apricot fruit based on transcriptome sequencing.\nDuring fruit ripening in the apricot cultivar 'Luntaixiaobaixing' (LT), the total carotenoid content of the fruit decreased significantly, as did the levels of the carotenoids \u03b2-carotene, lutein and violaxanthin (p\u2009<\u20090.01). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of the fruit resulted in the identification of 44,754 unigenes and 6916 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during ripening. Among these genes, 33,498 unigenes were annotated using public protein databases. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) showed that two of the 13 identified modules ('blue' and 'turquoise') were highly correlated with carotenoid metabolism, and 33 structural genes from the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway were identified. Network visualization revealed 35 intramodular hub genes that putatively control carotenoid metabolism. The expression levels of these candidate genes were determined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis, which showed ripening-associated carotenoid accumulation. This analysis revealed that a range of genes (NCED1, CCD1\/4, PIF3\/4, HY5, ERF003\/5\/12, RAP2-12, AP2, AP2-like, BZR1, MADS14, NAC2\/25, MYB1R1\/44, GLK1\/2 and WRKY6\/31\/69) potentially affect apricot carotenoid metabolism during ripening. Based on deciphering the molecular mechanism involved in ripening, a network model of carotenoid metabolism in apricot fruit was proposed.\nOverall, our work provides new insights into the carotenoid metabolism of apricot and other species, which will facilitate future apricot functional studies and quality breeding through molecular design.\n","375":"\nOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a major lethal malignant cancer of the head and neck region, yet its molecular mechanisms of tumourigenesis are still unclear.\nWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on RNA-sequencing data with clinical information obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The relationship between co-expression modules and clinical traits was investigated by Pearson correlation analysis. Furthermore, the prognostic value and expression level of the hub genes of these modules were validated based on data from the TCGA database and other independent datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the Human Protein Atlas database. The significant modules and hub genes were also assessed by functional analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).\nWe found that the turquoise module was strongly correlated with pathologic T stage and significantly enriched in critical functions and pathways related to tumourigenesis. PPP1R12B, CFD, CRYAB, FAM189A2 and ANGPTL1 were identified and statistically validated as hub genes in the turquoise module and were closely implicated in the prognosis of OSCC. GSEA indicated that five hub genes were significantly involved in many well-known cancer-related biological functions and signaling pathways.\nIn brief, we systematically discovered a co-expressed turquoise module and five hub genes associated with the pathologic T stage for the first time, which provided further insight that WGCNA may reveal the molecular regulatory mechanism involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of OSCC. In addition, the five hub genes may be considered candidate prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for the precise early diagnosis, clinical treatment and prognosis of OSCC in the future.\n\u00a92020 Hu et al.\n","376":"\nThe parthenogenetic marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) is a novel species that has rapidly invaded and colonized various different habitats. Adaptation to different environments appears to be independent of the selection of genetic variants, but epigenetic programming of the marbled crayfish genome remains to be understood.\nHere, we provide a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation in marbled crayfish. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of multiple replicates and different tissues revealed a methylation pattern that is characterized by gene body methylation of housekeeping genes. Interestingly, this pattern was largely tissue invariant, suggesting a function that is unrelated to cell fate specification. Indeed, integrative analysis of DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression patterns revealed that gene body methylation correlated with limited chromatin accessibility and stable gene expression, while low-methylated genes often resided in chromatin with higher accessibility and showed increased expression variation. Interestingly, marbled crayfish also showed reduced gene body methylation and higher gene expression variability when compared with their noninvasive mother species, Procambarus fallax.\nOur results provide novel insights into invertebrate gene body methylation and its potential role in adaptive gene regulation.\n","377":"\nNeonatal sepsis (NS) is considered as the most common cause of neonatal deaths that newborns suffer from. Although numerous studies focus on gene biomarkers of NS, the predictive value of the gene biomarkers is low. NS pathogenesis is still needed to be investigated.\nAfter data preprocessing, we used KEGG enrichment method to identify the differentially expressed pathways between NS and normal controls. Then, functional principal component analysis (FPCA) was adopted to calculate gene values in NS. In order to further study the key signaling pathway of the NS, elastic-net regression model, Mann-Whitney U test, and coexpression network were used to estimate the weights of signaling pathway and hub genes.\nA total of 115 different pathways between NS and controls were first identified. FPCA made full use of time-series gene expression information and estimated F values of genes in the different pathways. The top 1000 genes were considered as the different genes and were further analyzed by elastic-net regression and MWU test. There were 7 key signaling pathways between the NS and controls, according to different sources. Among those genes involved in key pathways, 7 hub genes, PIK3CA, TGFBR2, CDKN1B, KRAS, E2F3, TRAF6, and CHUK, were determined based on the coexpression network. Most of them were cancer-related genes. PIK3CA was considered as the common marker, which is highly expressed in the lymphocyte group. Little was known about the correlation of PIK3CA with NS, which gives us a new enlightenment for NS study.\nThis research might provide the perspective information to explore the potential novel genes and pathways as NS therapy targets.\n","378":"\nThe origin of novel traits is recognized as an important process underlying many major evolutionary radiations. We studied the genetic basis for the evolution of haustoria, the novel feeding organs of parasitic flowering plants, using comparative transcriptome sequencing in three species of Orobanchaceae. Around 180 genes are upregulated during haustorial development following host attachment in at least two species, and these are enriched in proteases, cell wall modifying enzymes, and extracellular secretion proteins. Additionally, about 100 shared genes are upregulated in response to haustorium inducing factors prior to host attachment. Collectively, we refer to these newly identified genes as putative \"parasitism genes.\" Most of these parasitism genes are derived from gene duplications in a common ancestor of Orobanchaceae and Mimulus guttatus, a related nonparasitic plant. Additionally, the signature of relaxed purifying selection and\/or adaptive evolution at specific sites was detected in many haustorial genes, and may play an important role in parasite evolution. Comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in parasitic and nonparasitic angiosperms suggests that parasitism genes are derived primarily from root and floral tissues, but with some genes co-opted from other tissues. Gene duplication, often taking place in a nonparasitic ancestor of Orobanchaceae, followed by regulatory neofunctionalization, was an important process in the origin of parasitic haustoria. \n\u00a9 The Author 2014.

In the \u03b2-globin gene family of placental mammals, the two postnatally expressed \u03b4- and \u03b2-globin genes (HBD and HBB, respectively) have a propensity for recombinational exchange via gene conversion and unequal crossing-over. In the latter case, there are good reasons to expect differences in retention rates for the reciprocal HBB\/HBD and HBD\/HBB fusion genes due to thalassemia pathologies associated with the HBD\/HBB \"Lepore\" deletion mutant in humans. Here, we report a comparative genomic analysis of the mammalian \u03b2-globin gene cluster, which revealed that chimeric HBB\/HBD fusion genes originated independently in four separate lineages of laurasiatherian mammals: Eulipotyphlans (shrews, moles, and hedgehogs), carnivores, microchiropteran bats, and cetaceans. In cases where an independently derived \"anti-Lepore\" duplication mutant has become fixed, the parental HBD and\/or HBB genes have typically been inactivated or deleted, so that the newly created HBB\/HBD fusion gene is primarily responsible for synthesizing the \u03b2-type subunits of adult and fetal hemoglobin (Hb). Contrary to conventional wisdom that the HBD gene is a vestigial relict that is typically inactivated or expressed at negligible levels, we show that HBD-like genes often encode a substantial fraction (20-100%) of \u03b2-chain Hbs in laurasiatherian taxa. Our results indicate that the ascendancy or resuscitation of genes with HBD-like coding sequence requires the secondary acquisition of HBB-like promoter sequence via unequal crossing-over or interparalog gene conversion. \n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.

Since particle swarm optimization has no complicated evolutionary operators and fewer parameters need to be adjusted, it has been used increasingly as an effective technique for gene selection. Since particle swarm optimization is apt to converge to local minima which lead to premature convergence, some particle swarm optimization based gene selection methods may select non-optimal genes with high probability. To select predictive genes with low redundancy as well as not filtering out key genes is still a challenge.\nTo obtain predictive genes with lower redundancy as well as overcome the deficiencies of traditional particle swarm optimization based gene selection methods, a hybrid gene selection method based on gene scoring strategy and improved particle swarm optimization is proposed in this paper. To select the genes highly related to out samples' classes, a gene scoring strategy based on randomization and extreme learning machine is proposed to filter much irrelevant genes. With the third-level gene pool established by multiple filter strategy, an improved particle swarm optimization is proposed to perform gene selection. In the improved particle swarm optimization, to decrease the likelihood of the premature of the swarm the Metropolis criterion of simulated annealing algorithm is introduced to update the particles, and the half of the swarm are reinitialized when the swarm is trapped into local minima.\nCombining the gene scoring strategy with the improved particle swarm optimization, the new method could select functional gene subsets which are significantly sensitive to the samples' classes. With the few discriminative genes selected by the proposed method, extreme learning machine and support vector machine classifiers achieve much high prediction accuracy on several public microarray data, which in turn verifies the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed gene selection method.\n","381":"\nManganese poisoning is a common occupational disease, studies have found that the susceptibility to manganese poisoning differs in individuals.

However, there are few researches which focus on the selection of the internal reference genes in Forsythia. To select the appropriate reference genes of Forsythia aimed at qRT-PCR normalization, twelve candidate reference genes were selected from our transcriptome data. Their expression was assessed by RT-PCR analysis in 47 Forsythia samples, including 12 species cultivars, different organs and tissues. GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software were used to select the appropriate reference genes, AG and PSY were used to verify the accuracy of the outcome. The results showed that UKN1 was a stable reference gene in leaves of twelve Forsythia germplasms and in different developmental stages of fruits.

The process of fruiting-body development in Lentinula edodes is complex and is greatly affected by environmental conditions. In this paper, 14 multicopper oxidase-encoding (laccase) genes were analyzed in the draft genome sequence of L. edodes strain W1-26, followed by a search of multiple stress-related Cis-elements in the promoter region of these laccase genes, and then a transcription profile analysis of 14 laccase genes (Lelcc) under the conditions of different carbon sources, temperatures, and photoperiods. All laccase genes were significantly regulated by varying carbon source materials. The expression of only two laccase genes (Lelcc5 and Lelcc6) was induced by sodium-lignosulphonate and the expression of most laccase genes was specifically upregulated in glucose medium. Under different temperature conditions, the expression levels of most laccase genes decreased at 39 \u00b0C and transcription was significantly increased for Lelcc1, Lelcc4, Lelcc5, Lelcc9, Lelcc12, Lelcc13, and Lelcc14 after induction for 24 h at 10 \u00b0C, indicating their involvement in primordium differentiation. Tyrosinase, which is involved in melanin synthesis, was clustered with the same group as Lelcc4 and Lelcc7 in all the different photoperiod treatments. Meanwhile, five laccase genes (Lelcc8, Lelcc9, Lelcc12, Lelcc13, and Lelcc14) showed similar expression profiles to that of two blue light receptor genes (LephrA and LephrB) in the 12 h light\/12 h dark treatment, suggesting the involvement of laccase genes in the adaptation process of L. edodes to the changing environment and fruiting-body formation. This study contributes to our understanding of the function of the different Lelcc genes and facilitates the screening of key genes from the laccase gene family for further functional research.\n","385":"\nTraditional pathway analysis map single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to genes according to physical position, which lacks sufficient biological bases. Here, we incorporated genetics of gene expression into gene- and pathway-based analysis to identify genes and pathways associated with lung cancer risk. We identified expression-related SNPs (eSNPs) in lung tissues and integrated these eSNPs into three lung cancer genome-wide association studies (GWASs), including 12,843 lung cancer cases and 12,639 controls. We used SKAT-C for gene-based analysis, and conditional analysis to identify independent eSNPs of each gene. ARTP algorithm was used for pathway analysis. A total of 374,382 eSNPs in the GWAS datasets survived quality control, which were mapped to 5,084 genes and 2,752 pathways. In the gene-based analysis, nine genes showed significant associations with lung cancer risk. Among them, TP63 (3q28), RP11-650L12.2 (15q25.1) and CHRNA5 (15q25.1) were located in known lung cancer susceptibility loci. We also validated two newly identified susceptibility loci (RNASET2 and AL133458.1 in 6q27, and MPZL3 in 11q23.3). Besides, DVL3 (3q27.1), RP11-522I20.3 (9q21.32) and CCDC116 (22q11.21) were identified as novel lung cancer susceptibility genes. Pathway analysis showed that pathways involved in protein structure, the Notch signaling pathway and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-related pathways were associated with lung cancer risk.

Its accurate application depends heavily upon normalisation of gene-of-interest data with reference genes that are uniformly expressed under experimental conditions. The aim of this study was to provide the first validation of reference genes for Lupinus angustifolius (narrow-leafed lupin, a significant grain legume crop) using a selection of seven genes previously trialed as reference genes for the model legume, Medicago truncatula. In a preliminary evaluation, the seven candidate reference genes were assessed on the basis of primer specificity for their respective targeted region, PCR amplification efficiency, and ability to discriminate between cDNA and gDNA. Following this assessment, expression of the three most promising candidates [Ubiquitin C (UBC), Helicase (HEL), and Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)] was evaluated using the NormFinder and RefFinder statistical algorithms in two narrow-leafed lupin lines, both with and without vernalisation treatment, and across seven organ types (cotyledons, stem, leaves, shoot apical meristem, flowers, pods and roots) encompassing three developmental stages. UBC was consistently identified as the most stable candidate and has sufficiently uniform expression that it may be used as a sole reference gene under the experimental conditions tested here. However, as organ type and developmental stage were associated with greater variability in relative expression, it is recommended using UBC and HEL as a pair to achieve optimal normalisation. These results highlight the importance of rigorously assessing candidate reference genes for each species across a diverse range of organs and developmental stages. With emerging technologies, such as RNAseq, and the completion of valuable transcriptome data sets, it is possible that other potentially more suitable reference genes will be identified for this species in future. \n","387":"\nExpansins (EXPs), a group of proteins that loosen plant cell walls and cellulosic materials, are involved in regulating cell growth and diverse developmental processes in plants.

These genes were classified into four subfamilies, including 67 GhEXPAs, 8 GhEXPBs, 6 GhEXLAs, and 12 GhEXLBs, and divided into 15 subgroups. The 93 expansin genes are distributed over 24 chromosomes, excluding Ghir_A02 and Ghir_D06. All GhEXP genes contain multiple exons, and each GhEXP protein has multiple conserved motifs. Transcript profiling and qPCR analysis revealed that the expansin genes have distinct expression patterns among different stages of cotton fibre development. Among them, 3 genes (GhEXPA4o, GhEXPA1A, and GhEXPA8h) were highly expressed in the initiation stage, 9 genes (GhEXPA4a, GhEXPA13a, GhEXPA4f, GhEXPA4q, GhEXPA8f, GhEXPA2, GhEXPA8g, GhEXPA8a, and GhEXPA4n) had high expression during the fast elongation stage, and GhEXLA1c and GhEXLA1f were preferentially expressed in the transition stage of fibre development.\nOur results provide a solid basis for further elucidation of the biological functions of expansin genes in relation to cotton fibre development and valuable genetic resources for future crop improvement.\n","388":"\nOsteosarcoma (OS), the most common malignant bone tumor, accounts for the heavy healthy threat in the period of children and adolescents.

Among 54 thymic carcinoma cases, RAS family mutations were detected in 10 cases, EGFR in two, PIK3CA in one, AKT1 in one, BRAF in none and TP53 in five. Among 33 thymoma type A\/B3 cases, HRAS gene mutation were found in one, PIK3CA in two and AKT1 in one. All these mutations were those of missense type activating mutations. RAS family mutations were significantly more frequent in thymic carcinoma than in thymoma type A\/B3 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0461). A prognostic analysis focusing on thymic squamous cell carcinoma cases (n\u00a0=\u00a044) showed that the overall survival was significantly shorter in patients with EGFR pathway mutations (n\u00a0=\u00a09) than in those without in a univariate analysis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0173).

The sterile insect technique was used to eradicate C.\u2009hominivorax from North and Central America. This involved area-wide releases of male and female flies that had been sterilized by radiation. Genetic systems have been developed for making 'male-only' strains that would improve the efficiency of genetic control of insect pests. One system involves induction of female lethality in embryos through activation of a pro-apoptotic gene by the tetracycline-dependent transactivator. Sex-specific expression is achieved using an intron from the transformer gene, which we previously isolated from several calliphorids.

Digital gene expression (DGE) profile technique was performed in this study to present gene expression patterns in an autotetraploid and its progenitor diploid watermelon, and deferentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the abiotic and biotic stress were also addressed. Altogether, 4,985 DEGs were obtained in the autotetraploid against its progenitor diploid, and 66.02% DEGs is up-regulated. GO analysis shows that these DEGs mainly distributed in 'metabolic process', 'cell' and 'catalytic activity'. KEGG analysis revealed that these DEGs mainly cover 'metabolic pathways', 'secondary metabolites' and 'ribosome'. Moreover, 134 tolerance related DEGs were identified which cover osmotic adjustment substance, protective enzymes\/protein, signaling proteins and pathogenesis-related proteins.

To analyze this high volume gene-expression data, one such powerful tool is Clustering. For any clustering algorithm, its efficiency majorly depends upon the underlying similarity\/dissimilarity measure. During the analysis of such data often there is a need to further explore the similarity of genes not only with respect to their expression values but also with respect to their functional annotations, which can be obtained from Gene Ontology (GO) databases. In the existing literature, several novel clustering and bi-clustering approaches were proposed to identify co-regulated genes from gene-expression datasets. Identifying co-regulated genes from gene expression data misses some important biological information about functionalities of genes, which is necessary to identify semantically related genes. In this paper, we have proposed sixteen different semantic gene-gene dissimilarity measures utilizing biological information of genes retrieved from a global biological database namely Gene Ontology (GO). Four proximity measures, viz. Euclidean, Cosine, point symmetry and line symmetry are utilized along with four different representations of gene-GO-term annotation vectors to develop total sixteen gene-gene dissimilarity measures. In order to illustrate the profitability of developed dissimilarity measures, some multi-objective as well as single-objective clustering algorithms are applied utilizing proposed measures to identify functionally similar genes from Mouse genome and Yeast datasets. Furthermore, we have compared the performance of our proposed sixteen dissimilarity measures with three existing state-of-the-art semantic similarity and distance measures.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Its dysregulation has a negative impact on many aspects of human health, such as obesity, lipid disorders, diabetes, skin regeneration, hematopoiesis and cancer. To date, poor is known on the molecular mechanisms that links mammary gland homeostasis to the circadian clock but recent reports highlight the importance of loss of circadian genes for mammary gland development and during tumour progression in breast cancer. Gene expression studies are then required to clarify how the circadian clock can modulates the human mammary gland development during ontology and its behaviour in physiological and oncogenic context. For this, in addition to genome-wide studies, real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) is a powerful and pertinent technique to quantify the expression of a reduced set of genes of interest in many different samples. Relative quantification of qPCR data requires the use of reference genes for normalisation. For circadian studies, reference genes expression must not oscillate in mirror of the circadian clock and must not be affected by the synchronisation protocols required in vitro to reset the circadian clock. Inappropriate selection of reference genes can consequently affect the amplitude of gene expression oscillation and bias data interpretation. Currently, no standard reference genes have been validated regarding these criteria for human mammary epithelial cells and the purpose of this study was to fill this gap. For this, we used the RefFinder tool, which combines four different algorithms, on 9 candidate reference genes. We compared reference genes stability using three different synchronisation protocols applied on four different mammary epithelial cell lines. This allowed us to define a set of reference genes in human mammary epithelial cells whose expression remains stable despite synchronisation protocols. We observed that the synchronisation of cells by serum shock was the most suitable procedure for maintaining the amplitude of oscillation of clock genes over time and we identified RPL4, RPLP0, HSPCB and TBP as an optimal combination of reference genes for the normalisation of the oscillatory expression of clock genes in human mammary epithelial cells.\n","394":"\nGiven the complex relationship between gene expression and phenotypic outcomes, computationally efficient approaches are needed to sift through large high-dimensional datasets in order to identify biologically relevant biomarkers. In this report, we describe a method of identifying the most salient biomarker genes in a dataset, which we call \"candidate genes\", by evaluating the ability of gene combinations to classify samples from a dataset, which we call \"classification potential\". Our algorithm, Gene Oracle, uses a neural network to test user defined gene sets for polygenic classification potential and then uses a combinatorial approach to further decompose selected gene sets into candidate and non-candidate biomarker genes. We tested this algorithm on curated gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) quantified in RNAseq gene expression matrices obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data repositories. First, we identified which MSigDB Hallmark subsets have significant classification potential for both the TCGA and GTEx datasets.

Different drivers often converge in the activation or repression of key cancer-relevant pathways. However, as many pathways contain multiple members of the same gene family, individual mutations might be overlooked, as each family member would necessarily have a lower mutation frequency and thus not identified as significant in any one-gene-at-a-time analysis. Here, we looked for mutated, functional sequence positions in gene families that were mutually exclusive (in patients) with another gene in the same pathway, which identified both known and new candidate oncodrivers. For instance, many inactivating mutations in multiple G-protein (particularly Gi\/o) coupled receptors, are mutually exclusive with G\u03b1s oncogenic activating mutations, both of which ultimately enhance cAMP signalling. By integrating transcriptomics and interaction data, we show that the Gs pathway is upregulated in multiple cancer types, even those lacking known GNAS activating mutations. This suggests that cancer cells may develop alternative strategies to activate adenylate cyclase signalling in multiple cancer types. Our study provides a mechanistic interpretation for several rare somatic mutations in multi-gene oncodrivers, and offers possible explanations for known and potential off-label cancer treatments, suggesting new therapeutic opportunities.\n","396":"\nBlack locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is an easy to raise, fast growing, medium-sized deciduous tree species highly tolerant to harsh eco-conditions, i.e., drought and harsh winters, and it is widely adaptable to sandy, loamy, and marshy soils.

Selection of a reliable gene for the normalization of qPCR data is important for obtaining accurate results in gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify an appropriate reference gene from 12 candidate genes for gene expression analysis in black locust exposed to various stressors such as abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and varying temperatures. In GeNorm and NormFinder analyses, ACT (actin) and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene expression were the most stable in all conditions except heat stress, but in BestKeeper analysis, GAPDH and helicase gene expression were the most stable under NaCl and heat stress. In contrast, ACT and GAPDH were highest under abscisic acid (ABA), GAPDH and \u03b2TUB (beta tubulin) under cold stress, and helicase and EF1\u03b1 (elongation factor 1 alpha) under PEG stress. We found that the most stable reference gene combination for all conditions was ACT and GAPDH. Additionally, the expression pattern of NAC2 (a transcription factor) and BGL2 in different tissues and under different stress conditions was analyzed relative to ACT and GAPDH and UBQ (ubiquitin) the least stably expressed gene.

Gsdf is specifically expressed in the gonads, and gene expression is restricted to the granulosa and Sertoli cells in trout and medaka. The gsdf gene expression is correlated to early testis differentiation in medaka and was shown to stimulate primordial germ cell and spermatogonia proliferation in trout. In the present study, we show that the gsdf gene localizes to a syntenic chromosomal fragment conserved among vertebrates although no gsdf-related gene is detected on the corresponding genomic region in tetrapods. We demonstrate using quantitative RT-PCR that most of the genes localized in the synteny are specifically expressed in medaka gonads. Gsdf is the only gene of the synteny with a much higher expression in the testis compared to the ovary. In contrast, gene expression pattern analysis of the gsdf surrounding genes (nup54, aff1, klhl8, sdad1, and ptpn13) indicates that these genes are preferentially expressed in the female gonads. The tissue distribution of these genes is highly similar in medaka and zebrafish, two teleostean species that have diverged more than 110 million years ago. The cellular localization of these genes was determined in medaka gonads using the whole-mount in situ hybridization technique. We confirm that gsdf gene expression is restricted to Sertoli and granulosa cells in contact with the premeiotic and meiotic cells. The nup54 gene is expressed in spermatocytes and previtellogenic oocytes. Transcripts corresponding to the ovary-specific genes (aff1, klhl8, and sdad1) are detected only in previtellogenic oocytes. No expression was detected in the gonocytes in 10 dpf embryos. In conclusion, we show that the gsdf gene localizes to a syntenic chromosomal fragment harboring evolutionary conserved genes in vertebrates. These genes are preferentially expressed in previtelloogenic oocytes, and thus, they display a different cellular localization compared to that of the gsdf gene indicating that the later gene is not co-regulated. Interestingly, our study identifies new clustered genes that are specifically expressed in previtellogenic oocytes (nup54, aff1, klhl8, sdad1).\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The three isolates produce the same pentasaccharide repeat unit, which consists of 5-N-acetyl-7-N-[(S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl] (major) or 5,7-di-N-acetyl (minor) derivatives of 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic (legionaminic) acid (Leg5Ac7R), D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. However, the linkage between repeat units in NIPH 70 was different to that in 1432 and 4190, and this significantly alters the CPS structure. The KL27 gene cluster in 4190 and KL44 gene cluster in NIPH 70 are organized identically and contain lga genes for Leg5Ac7R synthesis, genes for the synthesis of the common sugars, as well as anitrA2 initiating transferase and four glycosyltransferases genes. They share high-level nucleotide sequence identity for corresponding genes, but differ in the wzy gene encoding the Wzy polymerase. The Wzy proteins, which have different lengths and share no similarity, would form the unrelated linkages in the K27 and K44 structures. The linkages formed by the four shared glycosyltransferases were predicted by comparison with gene clusters that synthesize related structures. These findings unambiguously identify the linkages formed by WzyK27 and WzyK44, and show that the presence of different wzy genes in otherwise closely related K gene clusters changes the structure of the CPS. This may affect its capacity as a protective barrier for A. baumannii.\n\u00a9 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Increasing evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate target gene expression and participate in tumor genesis and progression. However, hub driving genes and regulators playing a potential role in LUAD progression have not been fully elucidated yet. Based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, 2837 differentially expressed genes, 741 DE-regulators were screened by comparing cancer tissues with paracancerous tissues. Then, 651 hub driving genes were selected by the topological relation of the protein-protein interaction network. Also, the target genes of DE-regulators were identified. Moreover, a key gene set containing 65 genes was obtained from the hub driving genes and target genes intersection. Subsequently, 183 hub regulators were selected based on the analysis of node degree in the ceRNA network. Next, a comprehensive analysis of the subgroups and Wnt, mTOR, and MAPK signaling pathways was conducted to understand enrichment of the subgroups. Survival analysis and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were further used to screen for the key genes and regulators. Furthermore, we verified key molecules based on external database, LRRK2, PECAM1, EPAS1, LDB2, and HOXA11-AS showed good results. LRRK2 was further identified as promising biomarker associated with CNV alteration and various immune cells' infiltration levels in LUAD. Overall, the present study provided a novel perspective and insight into hub driving genes and regulators in LUAD, suggesting that the identified signature could serve as an independent prognostic biomarker.\n\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).\n","404":"\nSelection of the right reference gene(s) is crucial in the analysis and interpretation of gene expression data. The aim of the present study was to discover and validate a minimal set of internal control genes in head and neck tumor studies. We analyzed data from multiple sources (in house whole-genome gene expression microarrays, previously published quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) data and RNA-seq data from TCGA) to come up with a list of 18 genes (discovery set) that had the lowest variance, a high level of expression across tumors, and their matched normal samples. The genes in the discovery set were ranked using four different algorithms (BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, and comparative delta Ct) and a web-based comparative tool, RefFinder, for their stability and variance in expression across tissues. Finally, we validated their expression using qPCR in an additional set of tumor:matched normal samples that resulted in five genes (RPL30, RPL27, PSMC5, MTCH1, and OAZ1), out of which RPL30 and RPL27 were most stable and were abundantly expressed across the tissues. Our data suggest that RPL30 or RPL27 in combination with either PSMC5 or MTCH1 or OAZ1 can be used as a minimal set of control genes in head and neck tumor gene expression studies.\n","405":"\nReference genes are important to precisely quantify gene expression by real-time PCR. In order to identify stable and reliable expressed genes in mycoparasite Clonostachys rosea in different modes of nutrition, seven commonly used housekeeping genes, 18S rRNA, actin, \u03b2-tubulin, elongation factor 1, ubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, from the effective biocontrol isolate C. rosea 67-1 were tested for their expression under sclerotial induction and during vegetative growth on PDA medium. Analysis by three software programs showed that differences existed among the candidates. Elongation factor 1 was most stable; the M value in geNorm, SD value in Bestkeeper and stability value in Normfinder analysis were 0.405, 0.450 and 0.442, respectively, indicating that the gene elongation factor 1 could be used to normalize gene expression in C. rosea in both vegetative growth and parasitic process. By using elongation factor 1, the expression of a serine protease gene, sep, in different conditions was assessed, which was consistent with the transcriptomic data. This research provides an effective method to quantitate expression changes of target genes in C. rosea, and will assist in further investigation of parasitism-related genes of this fungus. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Imprinted genes are involved in the etiology of rare syndromes and have been associated with common diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Standard RNA bulk cell sequencing applied to whole-tissue samples has been used to detect imprinted genes in human and mouse models. However, lowly expressed genes cannot be detected by using RNA bulk approaches. Here, we report an original and robust method that combines single-cell RNA-seq and whole-genome sequencing into an optimized statistical framework to analyze genomic imprinting in specific cell types and in different individuals. Using samples from the probands of 2 family trios and 3 unrelated individuals, 1,084 individual primary fibroblasts were RNA sequenced and more than 700,000 informative heterozygous single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) were genotyped. The allele-specific coverage per gene of each SNV in each single cell was used to fit a beta-binomial distribution to model the likelihood of a gene being expressed from one and the same allele. Genes presenting a significant aggregate allelic ratio (between 0.9 and 1) were retained to identify of the allelic parent of origin. Our approach allowed us to validate the imprinting status of all of the known imprinted genes expressed in fibroblasts and the discovery of nine putative imprinted genes, thereby demonstrating the advantages of single-cell over bulk RNA-seq to identify imprinted genes. The proposed single-cell methodology is a powerful tool for establishing a cell type-specific map of genomic imprinting.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 American Society of Human Genetics.

However, the causal genes expression and pathways of ADHD is still vague. We integrated GWAS, eQTL and genes expression data to find the causal genes, genes expression, and genes prioritization in the different brain tissues and whole blood cells. Overall 47 genes were prioritized, the most promising genes were LSG1, HYAL3, PIDD, PNPLA2, BLOC1S2, PLK1S1, CALN1, KAT2B, CTNNB1 and WDR11. Whereas, the CALN1, KAT2B, and WDR11 were previously associated with schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar (BP) and drug abuse. Gene ontology analysis shows that the glutamate receptor signaling pathway (P\u2009=\u20098.009E-07, with false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%), GRIK5 sub network (P\u2009=\u20092.887E-06, FDR\u2009<\u20095%), abnormal gait (P\u2009=\u20093.657E-06, FDR\u2009<\u20095%), REACTOME_SIGNALING_BY_ERBB2 (P\u2009=\u20095.161E-06, FDR\u2009<\u20095%), and abnormal nervous system physiology (P\u2009=\u20095.239E-06, FDR\u2009<\u20095%) were associated with ADHD. These causal genes were highly expressed in Fetal Astrocytes, Neurons, and Microglia\/Macrophage. This study illustrates the comprehensive GWAS integrative approach of ADHD. However, further genetic and functional studies are required to validate the role of these genes in the etiology of ADHD, which should provide novel insights into the understanding of this disease.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim was to determine whether predicted intrinsic protein disorder was differentially associated with proteins encoded by genes that are differentially regulated in lymphoma cells upon interaction with stromal cells, an interaction that occurs in microenvironments, such as lymph nodes that are protective for lymphoma cells during chemotherapy. Intrinsic disorder protein properties were extracted from the Database of Disordered Protein Prediction (D\u00b2P\u00b2), which contains data from nine intrinsic disorder predictors. Proteins encoded by differentially regulated cell-adhesion regulated genes were enriched in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) compared to other genes both with regard to IDR number and length. The enrichment was further ascribed to down-regulated genes. Consistently, a higher proportion of proteins encoded by down-regulated genes contained at least one IDR or were completely disordered. We conclude that down-regulated genes in stromal cell-adherent lymphoma cells encode proteins that are characterized by elevated levels of intrinsically disordered conformation, indicating the importance of down-regulating functional mechanisms associated with intrinsically disordered proteins in these cells. Further, the approach provides a generally applicable and complementary alternative to classification of differentially regulated genes using gene ontology or pathway enrichment analysis.\n","409":"\nBaculovirus infection impacts global gene expression in the host cell, including the expression of housekeeping genes. Evaluation of candidate reference genes during a viral infection will inform the selection of appropriate reference gene(s) for the normalization of expression data generated by Reverse Transcription Quantitative Real-timePolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Antheraea pernyi multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AnpeNPV) is able to infect the High Five cells (Tn-Hi5). In the present study, 10 candidate reference genes were evaluated in AnpeNPV-infected Tn-Hi5 cells. Gene expression data were analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The candidate genes were further validated as reliable reference genes for RT-qPCR by analyzing the expression of three target genes. The results of data analysis using four statistical methods showed that RPS18 was the least stable among the candidate reference genes tested. 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA were not suitable as reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in AnpeNPV-infected Tn-Hi5 cells. Comprehensive ranking of the 10 candidate reference genes by RefFinder analysis indicated that Ann B, c45128_g1, and ACT were the top three genes. Normalization of the expression of three target genes using the candidate reference genes indicated the same expression pattern when Ann B and c45128_g1 were used as reference genes, with slight differences in the relative expression at each infection time point. Overall, Ann B and c45128_g1 were recommended to be more suitable than the most commonly used reference genes, such as ACT, GAPDH, and TUB, for RT-qPCR data normalization in AnpeNPV-infected Tn-Hi5 cells up to 48 hpi.\n","410":"\nTIFY proteins are plant-specific proteins containing TIFY, JAZ, PPD and ZML subfamilies. A total of 50, 54 and 28 members of the TIFY gene family in three cultivated cotton species-Gossypium hirsutum, Gossypium barbadense and Gossypium arboretum-were identified, respectively. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that these TIFY genes were divided into eight clusters. The different clusters of gene family members often have similar gene structures, including the number of exons. The results of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that different JAZ genes displayed distinct expression patterns in the leaves of upland cotton under treatment with Gibberellin (GA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), Jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Different groups of JAZ genes exhibited different expression patterns in cotton leaves infected with Verticillium dahliae.

A subset of genes expressed in endosperm exhibit imprinted expression, and the correct balance of gene expression between parental alleles is critical for proper endosperm and seed development. We use a transcriptional time series analysis to identify genes that are associated with key shifts in seed development, including genes associated with secondary cell wall synthesis, mitotic cell cycle, chromatin organization, auxin synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and seed maturation. We relate these genes to morphological changes in Mimulus seeds. We also identify four endosperm-expressed transcripts that display imprinted (paternal) expression bias. The imprinted status of these four genes is conserved in other flowering plants, suggesting that they are functionally important in endosperm development. Our study explores gene regulatory dynamics in a species with ab initio cellular endosperm development, broadening the taxonomic focus of the literature on gene expression in seeds. Moreover, it is the first to validate genes with imprinted endosperm expression in Mimulus guttatus, and will inform future studies on the genetic causes of seed failure in this model system.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flores-Vergara, Oneal, Costa, Villarino, Roberts, De Luis Balaguer, Coimbra, Willis and Franks.\n","412":"\nIn warm-blooded vertebrates, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin genes are organized in domains of different types and are regulated in different fashion. In cold-blooded vertebrates and, in particular, the tropical fish Danio rerio, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin genes form two gene clusters. A major D. rerio globin gene cluster is in chromosome 3 and includes the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin genes of embryonic-larval and adult types. The region upstream of the cluster contains c16orf35, harbors the main regulatory element (MRE) of the \u03b1-globin gene domain in warm-blooded vertebrates. In this study, transient transfection of erythroid cells with genetic constructs containing a reporter gene under the control of potential regulatory elements of the domain was performed to characterize the promoters of the embryonic-larval and adult \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin genes of the major cluster. Also, in the 5th intron of c16orf35 in Danio reriowas detected a functional analog of the warm-blooded vertebrate MRE. This enhancer stimulated activity of the promoters of both adult and embryonic-larval \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin genes.\n","413":"\nGene-expression data is being widely used for various clinical research. It represents expression levels of thousands of genes across the various experimental conditions simultaneously. Mining conditions specific hub genes from gene-expression data is a challenging task. Conditions specific hub genes signify the functional behaviour of bicluster across the subset of conditions and can act as prognostic or diagnostic markers of the diseases. In this study, the authors have introduced a new approach for identifying conditions specific hub genes from the RNA-Seq data using a biclustering algorithm. In the proposed approach, efficient 'runibic' biclustering algorithm, the concept of gene co-expression network and concept of protein-protein interaction network have been used for getting better performance. The result shows that the proposed approach extracts biologically significant conditions specific hub genes which play an important role in various biological processes and pathways. These conditions specific hub genes can be used as prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers. Conditions specific hub genes will be helpful to reduce the analysis time and increase the accuracy of further research.

In addition to the relatively small set of core cas genes that are typically present in all CRISPR-Cas systems of a given (sub)type and are essential for the defense function, numerous genes occur in CRISPR-cas loci only sporadically. Some of these have been shown to perform various ancillary roles in CRISPR response, but the functional relevance of most remains unknown. We developed a computational strategy for systematically detecting genes that are likely to be functionally linked to CRISPR-Cas. The approach is based on a \"CRISPRicity\" metric that measures the strength of CRISPR association for all protein-coding genes from sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes. Uncharacterized genes with CRISPRicity values comparable to those of cas genes are considered candidate CRISPR-linked genes. We describe additional criteria to predict functionally relevance for genes in the candidate set and identify 79 genes as strong candidates for functional association with CRISPR-Cas systems. A substantial majority of these CRISPR-linked genes reside in type III CRISPR-cas loci, which implies exceptional functional versatility of type III systems. Numerous candidate CRISPR-linked genes encode integral membrane proteins suggestive of tight membrane association of CRISPR-Cas systems, whereas many others encode proteins implicated in various signal transduction pathways. These predictions provide ample material for improving annotation of CRISPR-cas loci and experimental characterization of previously unsuspected aspects of CRISPR-Cas system functionality.\n","415":"\nTeak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is currently the preferred choice of the timber trade for fabrication of woody products due to its extraordinary qualities and is widely grown around the world. Gene expression studies are essential to explore wood formation of vascular plants, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is a sensitive technique employed for quantifying gene expression levels. One or more appropriate reference genes are crucial to accurately compare mRNA transcripts through different tissues\/organs and experimental conditions. Despite being the focus of some genetic studies, a lack of molecular information has hindered genetic exploration of teak. To date, qRT-PCR reference genes have not been identified and validated for teak.\nIdentification and cloning of nine commonly used qRT-PCR reference genes from teak, including ribosomal protein 60s (rp60s), clathrin adaptor complexes medium subunit family (Cac), actin (Act), histone 3 (His3), sand family (Sand), \u03b2-Tubulin (\u0392-Tub), ubiquitin (Ubq), elongation factor 1-\u03b1 (Ef-1\u03b1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Expression profiles of these genes were evaluated by qRT-PCR in six tissue and organ samples (leaf, flower, seedling, root, stem and branch secondary xylem) of teak. Appropriate gene cloning and sequencing, primer specificity and amplification efficiency was verified for each gene. Their stability as reference genes was validated by NormFinder, BestKeeper, geNorm and Delta Ct programs. Results obtained from all programs showed that TgUbq and TgEf-1\u03b1 are the most stable genes to use as qRT-PCR reference genes and TgAct is the most unstable gene in teak. The relative expression of the teak cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (TgCAD) gene in lignified tissues at different ages was assessed by qRT-PCR, using TgUbq and TgEf-1\u03b1 as internal controls. These analyses exposed a consistent expression pattern with both reference genes.\nThis study proposes a first broad collection of teak tissue and organ mRNA expression data for nine selected candidate qRT-PCR reference genes. NormFinder, Bestkeeper, geNorm and Delta Ct analyses suggested that TgUbq and TgEf-1\u03b1 have the highest expression stability and provided similar results when evaluating TgCAD gene expression, while the commonly used Act should be avoided.\n","416":"\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a commonly occurring major congenital anomaly with a profound impact on neonatal mortality. The etiology of CDH is poorly understood and is complicated by multiple clinical presentations, reflecting the location and type of diaphragm defect. With the increased power of genetic screening, more genes are being associated with CDH, creating a knowledge gap between CDH-associated genes and their contribution to diaphragm embryogenesis. Our goal was to investigate CDH-associated genes and identify common pathways that may lead to abnormal diaphragm development. A comprehensive list of CDH-associated genes was identified from the literature and categorized according to multiple factors, including type of CDH. We undertook a large-scale gene function analysis using gene ontology to identify significantly enriched biological pathways and molecular functions associated with our gene set. We identified 218 CDH-associated genes. Our gene ontology analysis showed that genes representing distinct biological pathways are significantly enriched in relation to different clinical presentations of CDH. This includes retinoic acid signaling in Bochdalek CDH, myogenesis in diaphragm eventration, and angiogenesis in central tendon defects. We have identified unique genotype-phenotype relationships highlighting the major genetic drivers of the different types of CDH.\n","417":"\nAnaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria play an important role in the nitrogen cycle by coupling ammonium and nitrite to produce dinitrogen gas (N2). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a fast, simple, and sensitive method that is widely used to assess the diversity, abundance, and activity of the slow-growing bacteria. In this review, we summarize and evaluate the wide variety of PCR primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene and functional genes (hzo, nir, and hzs) of anammox bacteria for their effectiveness and efficiencies in detecting this group of bacteria in different sample types. Furthermore, the efficiencies of different universal high-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA gene primers in anammox bacteria investigations were also evaluated to provide a reference for primer selection. Based on our in silico evaluation results, none of the 16S rRNA gene primers could recover all of the known anammox bacteria, but multiple hzo and hzs gene primers could accomplish this task. However, uncertain copies (1-3 copies) of hzo genes were identified in the genomes, and the hydrazine oxidation reaction catalyzed by hydrazine oxidoreductases (HZOs) can also be catalyzed by other hydroxylamine oxidoreductases (HAOs) in anammox bacteria, which can potentially result in large deviations in hzo-based qPCR and RT-qPCR analyses and results. Therefore, the use of optimal primers targeting unique hzs genes are recommended, although the efficiencies of these newly designed primers need further verification in practical applications. This article provides comprehensive information for the effective and specific detection of anammox bacteria using specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene and functional genes and serves as a basis for future high-quality primer design.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Current gene models in this species are largely based on in silico predictions and low coverage expressed sequence tag (EST) evidence.\nAmphimedon queenslandica protein-coding gene models are improved using deep RNA-Seq data from four developmental stages and CEL-Seq data from 82 developmental samples. Over 86% of previously predicted genes are retained in the new gene models, although 24% have additional exons; there is also a marked increase in the total number of annotated 3' and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Importantly, these new developmental transcriptome data reveal numerous previously unannotated protein-coding genes in the Amphimedon genome, increasing the total gene number by 25%, from 30,060 to 40,122. In general, Amphimedon genes have introns that are markedly smaller than those in other animals and most of the alternatively spliced genes in Amphimedon undergo intron-retention; exon-skipping is the least common mode of alternative splicing. Finally, in addition to canonical polyadenylation signal sequences, Amphimedon genes are enriched in a number of unique AT-rich motifs in their 3' UTRs.\nThe inclusion of developmental transcriptome data has substantially improved the structure and composition of protein-coding gene models in Amphimedon queenslandica, providing a more accurate and comprehensive set of genes for functional and comparative studies. These improvements reveal the Amphimedon genome is comprised of a remarkably high number of tightly packed genes.

However, high homology among gene families might result in unsuitability of reference genes, which leads to the inaccuracy of qRT-PCR analysis. The release of the Ganoderma lucidum genome has triggered numerous studies to be done on the homology among gene families with the purpose of selecting reliable reference genes. Based on the G. lucdum genome and transcriptome database, 38 candidate reference genes including 28 novel genes were systematically selected and evaluated for qRT-PCR normalization. The result indicated that commonly used polyubiquitin (PUB), beta-actin (BAT), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were unsuitable reference genes because of the high sequence similarity and low primer specificity. According to the evaluation of RefFinder, cyclophilin 5 (CYP5) was ranked as the most stable reference gene for 27 tested samples under all experimental conditions and eighteen mycelial samples. Based on sequence analysis and expression analysis, our study suggested that gene characteristic, primer specificity of high homologous genes, allele-specificity expression of candidate genes and under-evaluation of reference genes influenced the accuracy and sensitivity of qRT-PCR analysis. This investigation not only revealed potential factors influencing the unsuitability of reference genes but also selected the superior reference genes from more candidate genes and testing samples than those used in the previous study. Furthermore, our study established a model for reference gene analysis by using the genomic sequence.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While the roles of this family in human diseases have been intensively studied, the information for plant HECTs is limited. In the present study, we performed the identification of HECT genes in Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea, followed by analysis of phylogeny, gene structure, additional domains, putative cis-regulatory elements, chromosomal location, synteny, and expression. Ten and 13 HECT genes were respectively identified in B. rapa and B. oleracea and then resolved into seven groups along with their Arabidopsis orthologs by phylogenetic analysis. This classification is well supported by analyses of gene structure, motif composition within the HECT domain and additional protein domains. Ka\/Ks ratio analysis showed that these HECT genes primarily underwent purifying selection with varied selection pressures resulting in different rates of evolution. RNA-Seq data analysis showed that the overwhelming majority of them were constitutively expressed in all tested tissues. qRT-PCR based expression analysis of the 10 B. rapa HECT genes under salt and drought stress conditions showed that all of them were responsive to the two stress treatments, which was consistent with their promoter sequence analysis revealing the presence of an important number of phytohormone-responsive and stress-related cis-regulatory elements.

Gene expression analysis is an efficient method to explore the possible regulatory mechanisms underlying these characteristics. Therefore, having the most suitable set of reference genes is required for transcript level normalization under different conditions in P. vera. In the present study, we selected eight widely used reference genes, ACT, EF1\u03b1, \u03b1-TUB, \u03b2-TUB, GAPDH, CYP2, UBQ10, and 18S rRNA. Using qRT-PCR their expression was assessed in 54 different samples of three cultivars of P. vera. The samples were collected from different organs under various abiotic treatments (cold, drought, and salt) across three time points. Several statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were applied to estimate the expression stability of candidate reference genes. Results obtained from the statistical analysis were then exposed to Rank aggregation package to generate a consensus gene rank. Based on our results, EF1\u03b1 was found to be the superior reference gene in all samples under all abiotic treatments. In addition to EF1\u03b1, ACT and \u03b2-TUB were the second best reference genes for gene expression analysis in leaf and root. We recommended \u03b2-TUB as the second most stable gene for samples under the cold and drought treatments, while ACT holds the same position in samples analyzed under salt treatment.

Furthermore, the impact of redundant protein coding sequences on the gene prediction results is studied. The results show that the problem of protein coding sequence redundancies cannot be ignored and the consistency of the gene annotation results before and after excluding the redundant sequences is negatively related with the sequences redundancy degree of the protein coding sequences in the training set.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, information about the PI gene families in tomato (Solanumlycopersicum), one of the most important model plant for crop species, is limited. In this study, in silico analysis identified 55 PI genes and their conserved domains, phylogenetic relationships, and chromosome locations were characterized. According to genetic structure and evolutionary relationships, the PI gene families were divided into seven families. Genome-wide microarray transcription analysis indicated that the expression of SlPI genes can be induced by abiotic (heat, drought, and salt) and biotic (Botrytiscinerea and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)) stresses. In addition, expression analysis using RNA-seq in various tissues and developmental stages revealed that some SlPI genes were highly or preferentially expressed, showing tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression profiles. The expressions of four representative SlPI genes in response to abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (Eth), gibberellic acid (GA). and methyl viologen (MV) were determined. Our findings indicated that PI genes may mediate the response of tomato plants to environmental stresses to balance hormone signals. The data obtained here will improve the understanding of the potential function of PI gene and lay a foundation for tomato breeding and transgenic resistance to stresses.\n","425":"\nAdvances in sequencing technology have led to expanded use of multi-gene panel tests (MGPTs) for clinical diagnostics. Well-designed MGPTs must balance increased detection of clinically significant findings while mitigating the increase in variants of uncertain\u00a0significance (VUS). To maximize clinical utililty, design of such panels should include comprehensive gene vetting using a standardized clinical validity (CV) scoring system.\nTo assess the impact of CV-based gene vetting on MGPT results, data from MGPTs for cardiovascular indications were retrospectively analyzed. Using our CV scoring system, genes were categorized as having definitive, strong, moderate, or limited evidence. The rates of reported pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and VUS were then determined for each CV category.\nOf 106 total genes, 42% had definitive, 17% had strong, 29% had moderate, and 12% had limited CV. The detection rate of variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic was higher for genes with greater CV, while the VUS rate showed an inverse relationship with CV score. No pathogenic or likely pathogenic findings were observed in genes with a limited CV.\nThese results demonstrate the importance of a standardized, evidence-based vetting process to establish CV for genes on MGPTs. Using our proposed system may help to increase the detection rate while mitigating higher VUS rates.\n\u00a9 2019 Ambry Genetics.

The aim of this study was to reveal key genes for prognosis and establish prognostic gene signatures based on genes encoded by chr1p\/19q. Materials and methods: The data was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between lower grade glioma tissue and normal brain were identified. The univariate COX regression, robust likelihood-base survival analysis (rbsurv) and multivariate COX regression analysis were used to establish the 4-gene-signature based on the DEGs. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Kaplan-Mere curve were used to verify the prediction accuracy of the signature. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were also performed to explore the reasons for good prognosis in patients with chr1p\/19q deletion. Results: A total of 1346 DEGs were identified between lower grade glioma samples and normal brain samples in GSE16011, including 56 up-regulated mRNAs located on chr1p and 20 up-regulated mRNAs located on chr19q. We established a 4-gene-signature that was significantly associated with survival based on the 76 gene. The AUC of the 4-gene-signature for 5-year OS in TCGA and CGGA was 0.837 and 0.876, respectively, which was superior compared to other parameters such as chr1p\/19q co-deletion, IDH mutant, WHO grade and histology type, especially in chr1p\/19q non-co-deletion patients. GSEA and KEGG analysis suggested that the prolongation of chr1p\/19q in patients could be associated with cell cycle and DNA mismatch repairing. Conclusions: We established a robust 4-gene-signature based on the chr1p\/19q and we explored the potential function of these newly identified survival-associated genes by bioinformatics analysis. The 4-gene from the signature are promising molecular targets to be used in the future.\n","427":"\nInvestigation of sex determination system in Eriocheir sinensis is important because of sex-dimorphism in its growth traits. However, little information about the sex-related genes in embryonic development stages were exposed. To obtain more information of sex determination in Chinese mitten crab, we performed the transcriptome analysis in embryonic development stage (fertilized egg stage, cleavage stage, blastula stage, gastrula stage and heartbeat stage) of Chinese mitten crab using nextgeneration sequencing technology. Thirty-one of 32,088 annotated unigenes were identified as sex-related genes including 16 genes involved in primary sex determination in model organisms and 8 genes of SOX family and 7 genes of DMRT gene family. Heatmap based on the RPKM value in five embryonic development stages indicated that these genes were clustered into two branches. Analysis of the differentially expressed 12 genes, including 3 genes of SOX family, 3 genes of DMRT gene family and 6 genes involved in primary sex determination in model organisms, showed significantly difference between the first three periods (fertilized egg stage-cleavage stage-blastula stage) and the last two periods (gastrula stage-heartbeat stage) and all 12 genes were up-regulated after blastula stage. In conclusion, we inferred that sex determination might be initiated after blastula stage in E. sinensis. Transcriptome analysis from embryonic development stage could provide a background information for further investigation in sex determination of Eriocheir sinensis.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019.

Previously, gene expression studies of mucosal colonic biopsies have provided some insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms in ulcerative colitis; however, the exact pathogenesis is unclear. The purpose of this study is to identify the most related genes and pathways of UC by bioinformatics, so as to reveal the core of the pathogenesis.\nGenome-wide gene expression datasets involving ulcerative colitis patients were collected from gene expression omnibus database. To identify most close genes, an integrated analysis of gene expression signature was performed by employing robust rank aggregation method. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis to explore the functional modules involved in ulcerative colitis pathogenesis. Besides, biological process and pathways analysis of co-expression modules were figured out by gene ontology enrichment analysis using Metascape.\nA total of 328 ulcerative colitis patients and 138 healthy controls were from 14 datasets. The 150 most significant differentially expressed genes are likely to include causative genes of disease, and further studies are needed to demonstrate this. Seven main functional modules were identified, which pathway enrichment analysis indicated were associated with many biological processes. Pathways such as 'extracellular matrix, immune inflammatory response, cell cycle, material metabolism' are consistent with the core mechanism of ulcerative colitis. However, 'defense response to virus' and 'herpes simplex infection' suggest that viral infection is one of the aetiological agents. Besides, 'Signaling by Receptor Tyrosine Kinases' and 'pathway in cancer' provide new clues for the study of the risk and process of ulcerative colitis cancerization.\n\u00a92019 Zhu et al.\n","429":"\nThoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a catastrophic disease worldwide, but the pathogenic genes and pathways are largely unclear. This study aims at integrating two gene expression profile datasets and verifying hub genes and pathways involved in TAD as well as exploring potential molecular mechanisms. We will combine our mRNAs expression profile (6 TAD tissues versus 6 non-TAD tissues) and GSE52093 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The two mRNAs expression profiles contained 13 TAD aortic tissues and 11 non-TAD tissues. The two expression profile datasets were integrated and we found out coexpression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using bioinformatics methods. The gene ontology and pathway enrichment of DEGs were performed by DAVID and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes online analyses, respectively. The protein-protein interaction networks of the DEGs were constructed according to the data from the STRING database. Cytohubber calculating result shows the top 10 hub genes with CDC20, AURKA, RFC4, MCM4, TYMS, MCM2, DLGAP5, FANCI, BIRC5, and POLE2. Module analysis revealed that TAD was associated with significant pathways including cell cycle, vascular smooth muscle contraction, and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes. The qRT-PCR result showed that the expression levels of all the hub genes were significantly increased in OA samples (p < 0.05), and these candidate genes could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of TAD.\n","430":"\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition that affects more than 15 million individuals globally. However, a predictive molecular biomarker to distinguish the different stages of AD patients is still lacking.\nA weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to systematically identify the co-expressed gene modules and hub genes connected with AD development based on a microarray dataset (GSE1297) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. An independent validation cohort, GSE28146, was utilized to assess the diagnostic efficiency for distinguishing the different stages of AD. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis were applied to examine the mRNA and protein level of GRIK1, respectively, in AD mice established with the expression of mutant amyloid precursor protein and wild type mice. The morphology of neurons was investigated using phalloidin staining.\nWe identified 16 co-expressed genes modules, with the pink module showing significant association with all three disease statuses [neurofibrillary tangle (NFT), BRAAK, and mini-mental state examination (MMSE)]. Enrichment analysis specified that these modules were enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and ion transmembrane transport. The validation cohort GSE28146 confirmed that six hub genes in the pink module could distinguish severe and non-severe AD patients [area under the curve (AUC) >0.7]. These hub genes might act as a biomarker and help to differentiate diverse pathological stages for AD patients. Finally, one of the hubs, GRIK1, was validated by an animal AD model. The mRNA and protein level of GRIK1 in the AD hippocampus was increased compared with the control group (NC) hippocampus. Phalloidin staining showed that dendritic length of the GRIK1 pCDNA3.1 group was shorter than that of the NC group.\nIn summary, we systematically recognized co-expressed gene modules and genes related to AD stages, which gave insight into the fundamental mechanisms of AD progression and revealed some probable targets for the treatment of AD.\n2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

The SNPs of 17 patients and the preprocessed SNP profiling GSE 32258 (38 cases of normal breast cells) were combined to identify their correlation with breast cancer using chi-square test. The gene expression profiling batch8_9 (38 cases of patients and 8 cases of normal tissue) was preprocessed with limma package, and the DEGs were filtered out. Then fisher's method was applied to integrate DEGs and SNPs associated with breast cancer. With NetBox software, TRED (Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database) and UCSC (University of California Santa Cruz) database, genes-associated network and transcriptional regulatory network were constructed using cytoscape software. Further, GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG analyses were performed for genes in the networks by using siggenes. In total, 332 DEGs were identified. There were 160 breast cancer-related SNPs related to 106 genes of gene expression profiling (19 were significant DEGs). Finally, 11co-correlated DEGs were selected. In genes-associated network, 9 significant DEGs were correlated to 23 LINKER genes while, in transcriptional regulatory network, E2F1 had regulatory relationships with 7 DEGs including MTUS1, CD44, CCNB1 and CCND2. KRAS with SNP locus of rs1137282 was involved in 35 KEGG pathways. The genes of MTUS1, CD44, CCNB1, CCND2 and KRAS with specific SNP loci may be used as biomarkers for diagnosis of breast cancer.

However, the validity of this assumption needs to be assessed using robust experimental data. We conducted tissue-specific gene expression and protein function analyses of orthologous groups within the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene family in three closely related Populus species: Populus trichocarpa, Populus euphratica and Populus yatungensis. This study identified 21 GST orthologous groups in the three Populus species. Although the sequences of the GST orthologous groups were highly conserved, the divergence in enzymatic functions was prevalent. Through site-directed mutagenesis of orthologous proteins, this study revealed that nonsynonymous substitutions at key amino acid sites played an important role in the divergence of enzymatic functions. In particular, a single amino acid mutation (Arg39\u2192Trp39) contributed to P.\u00a0euphratica PeGSTU30 possessing high enzymatic activity via increasing the hydrophobicity of the active cavity. This study provided experimental evidence showing that orthologues belonging to the gene family have functional divergences. The nonsynonymous substitutions at a few amino acid sites resulted in functional divergence of the orthologous genes. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution of orthologous genes in closely related species.\n\u00a9 2018 The Authors.

Differentiation of their spatiotemporal expression patterns and absorption spectra enables fine-tuning of feature detection in spectrally distinct regions of the visual field during ontogeny. Zebrafish have quadruplicated green-sensitive (RH2) opsin genes in tandem (RH2-1, -2, -3, -4), which are expressed in the short member of the double cones (SDC). The shortest wavelength RH2 subtype (RH2-1) is expressed in the central to dorsal area of the adult retina. The second shortest wave subtype (RH2-2) is expressed overlapping with RH2-1 but extending outside of it. The second longest wave subtype (RH2-3) is expressed surrounding the RH2-2 area, and the longest wave subtype (RH2-4) is expressed outside of the RH2-3 area broadly occupying the ventral area. Expression of the four RH2 genes in SDC requires a single enhancer (RH2-LCR), but the mechanism of their spatial differentiation remains elusive.\nFunctional comparison of the RH2-LCR with its counterpart in medaka revealed that the regulatory role of the RH2-LCR in SDC-specific expression is evolutionarily conserved. By combining the RH2-LCR and the proximal upstream region of each RH2 gene with fluorescent protein reporters, we show that the RH2-LCR and the RH2-3 proximal regulatory region confer no spatial selectivity of expression in the retina. But those of RH2-1, -2 and -4 are capable of inducing spatial differentiation of expression. Furthermore, by analyzing transgenic fish with a series of arrays consisting of the RH2-LCR and multiple upstream regions of the RH2 genes in different orders, we show that a gene expression pattern related to an upstream region is greatly influenced by another flanking upstream region in a relative position-dependent manner.\nThe zebrafish RH2 genes except RH2-3 acquired differential cis-elements in the proximal upstream regions to specify the differential expression patterns. The input from these proximal elements collectively dictates the actual gene expression pattern of the locus, context-dependently. Importantly, competition for the RH2-LCR activity among the replicates is critical in this collective regulation, facilitating differentiation of expression among them. This combination of specificity and generality enables seemingly complicated spatial differentiation of duplicated opsin genes characteristic in fish.\n","434":"\nFood security is a global concern. Fusarium are among the most economically important fungal pathogens because they are ubiquitous, disease management remains a challenge, they produce mycotoxins that affect food and feed safety, and trichothecene mycotoxin production can increase the pathogenicity of some Fusarium species depending on the host species. Although trichothecenes may differ in structure by their patterns of hydroxylation or acetylation, these small changes have a significant impact on toxicity and the biological activity of these compounds. Therefore, detecting and identifying which chemotype is present in a given population are important to predicting the specific toxins that may be produced and, therefore, to evaluating the risk of exposure. Due to the challenges of inducing trichothecene production by Fusarium isolates in vitro for subsequent chemical analysis, PCR assays using gene-specific primers, either singly or in combination, designed against specific genes of the trichothecene gene cluster of multiple species of Fusarium have been developed. The establishment of TRI genotypes that potentially correspond to a specific chemotype requires examination of an information and knowledge pipeline whose critical aspects in sequential order are: (i) understanding the TRI gene cluster organization which differs according to Fusarium species under study; (ii) knowledge of the re-arrangements to the core TRI gene cluster over evolutionary time, which also differs according to Fusarium species; (iii) the functions of the TRI genes in the biosynthesis of trichothecene analogs; and (iv) based on (i)\u207b(iii), selection of appropriate target TRI gene(s) for primer design in PCR amplification for the Fusarium species under study. This review, therefore, explains this pipeline and its connection to utilizing TRI genotypes as a possible proxy to chemotype designation.\n","435":"\nRecent studies have highlighted the role of gene networks in disease biology. To formally assess this, we constructed a broad set of pathway, network, and pathway+network annotations and applied stratified LD score regression to 42 diseases and complex traits (average N = 323K) to identify enriched annotations. First, we analyzed 18,119 biological pathways. We identified 156 pathway-trait pairs whose disease enrichment was statistically significant (FDR < 5%) after conditioning on all genes and 75 known functional annotations (from the baseline-LD model), a stringent step that greatly reduced the number of pathways detected; most significant pathway-trait pairs were previously unreported. Next, for each of four published gene networks, we constructed probabilistic annotations based on network connectivity. For each gene network, the network connectivity annotation was strongly significantly enriched. Surprisingly, the enrichments were fully explained by excess overlap between network annotations and regulatory annotations from the baseline-LD model, validating the informativeness of the baseline-LD model and emphasizing the importance of accounting for regulatory annotations in gene network analyses. Finally, for each of the 156 enriched pathway-trait pairs, for each of the four gene networks, we constructed pathway+network annotations by annotating genes with high network connectivity to the input pathway. For each gene network, these pathway+network annotations were strongly significantly enriched for the corresponding traits. Once again, the enrichments were largely explained by the baseline-LD model. In conclusion, gene network connectivity is highly informative for disease architectures, but the information in gene networks may be subsumed by regulatory annotations, emphasizing the importance of accounting for known annotations.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

A total of 9 genes (CCND2, EGFR, GSTP1, PGR, PTGS2, RECK, SOX17, TNFRSF10D, and WIF1) showed significant negative correlation between methylation and gene expression, which were validated in the TCGA database.

The biggest challenge to overcome cancer is to identify driver genes that promote the cancer development from a huge amount of passenger mutations that have no effect on the selective growth advantage of cancer. In order to solve those problems, some researchers have started to focus on identification of driver genes by integrating networks with other biological information. However, more efforts should be needed to improve the prediction performance.\nConsidering the facts that driver genes have impact on expression of their downstream genes, they likely interact with each other to form functional modules and those modules should tend to be expressed similarly in the same tissue. We proposed a novel model named by DyTidriver to identify driver genes through involving the gene dysregulated expression, tissue-specific expression and variation frequency into the human functional interaction network (e.g. human FIN).\nThis method was applied on 974 breast, 316 prostate and 230 lung cancer patients. The consequence shows our method outperformed other five existing methods in terms of Fscore, Precision and Recall values. The enrichment and cociter analysis illustrate DyTidriver can not only identifies the driver genes enriched in some significant pathways but also has the capability to figure out some unknown driver genes.\nThe final results imply that driver genes are those that impact more dysregulated genes and express similarly in the same tissue.\n","438":"\nThe incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the developed world has risen over the last century, concomitant with an increase in average human lifespan. A major challenge is therefore to identify genes that control neuronal health and viability with a view to enhancing neuronal health during ageing and reducing the burden of neurodegeneration. Analysis of gene expression data has recently been used to infer gene functions for a range of tissues from co-expression networks. We have now applied this approach to transcriptomic datasets from the mammalian nervous system available in the public domain. We have defined the genes critical for influencing neuronal health and disease in different neurological cell types and brain regions. The functional contribution of genes in each co-expression cluster was validated using human disease and knockout mouse phenotypes, pathways and gene ontology term annotation. Additionally a number of poorly annotated genes were implicated by this approach in nervous system function. Exploiting gene expression data available in the public domain allowed us to validate key nervous system genes and, importantly, to identify additional genes with minimal functional annotation but with the same expression pattern. These genes are thus novel candidates for a role in neurological health and disease and could now be further investigated to confirm their function and regulation during ageing and neurodegeneration.\n","439":"\nImmune repertoires are collections of lymphocytes that express diverse antigen receptor gene rearrangements consisting of Variable (V), (Diversity (D) in the case of heavy chains) and Joining (J) gene segments. Clonally related cells typically share the same germline gene segments and have highly similar junctional sequences within their third complementarity determining regions. Identifying clonal relatedness of sequences is a key step in the analysis of immune repertoires. The V gene is the most important for clone identification because it has the longest sequence and the greatest number of sequence variants. However, accurate identification of a clone's germline V gene source is challenging because there is a high degree of similarity between different germline V genes. This difficulty is compounded in antibodies, which can undergo somatic hypermutation. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing experiments often generate partial sequences and have significant error rates. To address these issues, we describe a novel method to estimate which germline V genes (or alleles) cannot be discriminated under different conditions (read lengths, sequencing errors or somatic hypermutation frequencies). Starting with any set of germline V genes, this method measures their similarity using different sequencing lengths and calculates their likelihood of unambiguous assignment under different levels of mutation. Hence, one can identify, under different experimental and biological conditions, the germline V genes (or alleles) that cannot be uniquely identified and bundle them together into groups of specific V genes with highly similar sequences. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Significant results at the corrected p-value of p\u00a0<\u00a01.90\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-4 were examined in an independent replication sample of Dutch adolescents (N\u00a0=\u00a01354).\nTwo genes showed evidence for interaction with perceived support: GABRR1 (p\u00a0=\u00a04.62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-5 ) and GABRR2 (p\u00a0=\u00a09.05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-6 ). No genes interacted significantly with psychological control or harsh punishment. Gene-based analysis was unable to confirm the interaction of GABRR1 or GABRR2 with support in the replication sample. However, for GABRR2, but not GABRR1, the correlation of the estimates between the two datasets was significant (r (46)\u00a0=\u00a0.32; p\u00a0=\u00a0.027) and a gene-based analysis of the combined datasets supported GABRR2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0support interaction (p\u00a0=\u00a01.63\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-4 ).\nWe present a gene-based method for gene-environment interactions in a polygenic context and show that genes interact differently with particular aspects of parenting.

However, functional validation for most candidate CRC driver genes, which were commonly identified from both human and mice, has not been performed. Here, we describe a platform for functionally validating CRC driver genes that utilizes CRISPR-Cas9 in mouse intestinal tumor organoids and human CRC-derived organoids in xenograft mouse models. We used genetically defined benign tumor-derived organoids carrying 2 frequent gene mutations (Apc and Kras mutations), which act in the early stage of CRC development, so that we could clearly evaluate the tumorigenic ability of the mutation in a single gene. These studies showed that Acvr1b, Acvr2a, and Arid2 could function as tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in CRC and uncovered a role for Trp53 in tumor metastasis. We also showed that co-occurrent mutations in receptors for activin and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) synergistically promote tumorigenesis, and shed light on the role of activin receptors in CRC.

Taken together, these results indicate that B2M and 18S are the most stable gene across tissue types under normal physiological conditions. However, during poly I:C stimulation, no single gene or single pair of genes in the examined set of housekeeping genes can serve as a universal reference across all tissue types. If one gene is preferred, B2M, B2M, UBCE, Actin, B2M\/RPL13, B2M, B2M, and RPL13 may be used in spleen, kidney, liver, gill, intestine, brain, muscle, and heart of golden pompano, respectively.\n","444":"\nDisease resistance genes (R genes), as part of the plant defense system, have coevolved with corresponding pathogen molecules. The main objectives of this project were to identify non-Toll interleukin receptor, nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat (nTNL) genes and elucidate their evolutionary divergence across six plant genomes. Using reference sequences from Arabidopsis, we investigated nTNL orthologs in the genomes of common bean, Medicago, soybean, poplar, and rice. We used Hidden Markov Models for sequence identification, performed model-based phylogenetic analyses, visualized chromosomal positioning, inferred gene clustering, and assessed gene expression profiles. We analyzed 908 nTNL R genes in the genomes of the six plant species, and classified them into 12 subgroups based on the presence of coiled-coil (CC), nucleotide binding site (NBS), leucine rich repeat (LRR), resistance to Powdery mildew 8 (RPW8), and BED type zinc finger domains. Traditionally classified CC-NBS-LRR (CNL) genes were nested into four clades (CNL A-D) often with abundant, well-supported homogeneous subclades of Type-II R genes. CNL-D members were absent in rice, indicating a unique R gene retention pattern in the rice genome. Genomes from Arabidopsis, common bean, poplar and soybean had one chromosome without any CNL R genes. Medicago and Arabidopsis had the highest and lowest number of gene clusters, respectively. Gene expression analyses suggested unique patterns of expression for each of the CNL clades. Differential gene expression patterns of the nTNL genes were often found to correlate with number of introns and GC content, suggesting structural and functional divergence.\n","445":"\nThe timing of human puberty is highly variable, sexually dimorphic, and associated with adverse health outcomes. Over 20 genes carrying rare mutations have been identified in known pubertal disorders, many of which encode critical components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 candidate genes at loci associated with age at menarche or voice breaking in males. We know little about the spatial, temporal or postnatal expression patterns of the majority of these puberty-associated genes. Using a high-throughput and sensitive microfluidic quantitative PCR strategy, we profiled the gene expression patterns of the mouse orthologs of 178 puberty-associated genes in male and female mouse HPG axis tissues, the pineal gland, and the liver at five postnatal ages spanning the pubertal transition. The most dynamic gene expression changes were observed prior to puberty in all tissues. We detected known and novel tissue-enhanced gene expression patterns, with the hypothalamus expressing the largest number of the puberty-associated genes. Notably, over 40 puberty-associated genes in the pituitary gland showed sex-biased gene expression, most of which occurred peri-puberty. These sex-biased genes included the orthologs of candidate genes at GWAS loci that show sex-discordant effects on pubertal timing. Our findings provide new insight into the expression of puberty-associated genes and support the possibility that the pituitary plays a role in determining sex differences in the timing of puberty.\n\u00a9 The Author 2017.

This could be the footprint of sexually antagonistic (SA) alleles that are maintained by balancing selection in a PAR gene (or genes) and affect polymorphism in linked genome regions. SA selection is predicted to occur during sex chromosome evolution, but it is important to test whether the unexpectedly high sequence polymorphism could be explained without it, purely by the combined effects of partial linkage with the sex-determining region and the population's demographic history, including possible introgression from Silene dioica. To test this, we applied approximate Bayesian computation-based model choice to autosomal sequence diversity data, to find the most plausible scenario for the recent history of S.\u00a0latifolia and then to estimate the posterior density of the most relevant parameters. We then used these densities to simulate variation to be expected at PAR genes. We conclude that an excess of variants at high frequencies at PAR genes should arise in S.\u00a0latifolia populations only for genes with strong associations with fully sex-linked genes, which requires closer linkage with the fully sex-linked region than that estimated for the PAR genes where apparent deviations from neutrality were observed. These results support the need to invoke selection to explain the S.\u00a0latifolia PAR gene diversity, and encourage further work to test the possibility of balancing selection due to sexual antagonism.\n\u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n","447":"\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common subtype in liver cancer whose prognosis is affected by malignant progression associated with complex gene interactions. However, there is currently no available biomarkers associated with HCC progression in clinical application. In our study, RNA sequencing expression data of 50 normal samples and 374 tumor samples was analyzed and 9225 differentially expressed genes were screened. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was then conducted and the blue module we were interested was identified by calculating the correlations between 17 gene modules and clinical features. In the blue module, the calculation of topological overlap was applied to select the top 30 genes and these 30 genes were divided into the green group (11 genes) and the yellow group (19 genes) through searching whether these genes were validated by in vitro or in vivo experiments. The genes in the green group which had never been validated by any experiments were recognized as hub genes. These hub genes were subsequently validated by a new data set GSE76427 and KM Plotter Online Tool, and the results indicated that 10 genes (FBXO43, ARHGEF39, MXD3, VIPR1, DNASE1L3, PHLDA1, CSRNP1, ADR2B, C1RL, and CDC37L1) could act as prognosis and progression biomarkers of HCC. In summary, 10 genes who have never been mentioned in HCC were identified to be associated with malignant progression and prognosis of patients. These findings may contribute to the improvement of the therapeutic decision, risk stratification, and prognosis prediction for HCC patients.\n\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","448":"\nCystic fibrosis (CF) patients commonly suffer from continuous and recurrent lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the dominant pathogen in CF airways. This study aimed to determine the integron types, gene cassettes, virulence determinants, \u03b2-lactam resistance genes, biofilm formation and alginate production in P. aeruginosa isolated from Iranian CF patients. A total of 143 P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained from CF patients. Susceptibility of isolates to different antimicrobials was evaluated by disc diffusion method. ESBL, MBL and KPC production was assessed. Congo red agar and tissue culture plates were used for evaluation of biofilm formation. Alginate production was determined using the Carbazole assay. Integrase genes, resistance determinants (ESBLs, MBLs and KPC) and genes encoding virulence factors were evaluated by PCR. All isolates were susceptible to colistin, piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin; 8.4% of isolates were considered as MDR phenotype. Out of 6.3% IPM-resistant isolates, prevalence of virulence genes was as follows: lasB (100%) and plcB (100%), plcH (96.5%). Biofilm formation and alginate production ability were found in 54.5% of isolates. The prevalence of the alginate-encoding genes was 92.3%, 86.7% and 67.1% for algD, algU and algL genes, respectively. PpyR, pslA and pelA genes were detected in 98.6%, 89.5% and 57.3% of the isolates, respectively. The high prevalence of colonization in CF lungs may increase the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa due to their adhesion and protective properties caused by biofilm- and alginate-production. LasB, plcB, plcH, exoS, toxA, algD, ppyR and pslA genes were predominant in CF P. aeruginosa strains.\n","449":"\nGene models from draft genome assemblies of metazoan species are often incorrect, missing exons or entire genes, particularly for large gene families. Consequently, labour-intensive manual curation is often necessary. We present Figmop (Finding Genes using Motif Patterns) to help with the manual curation of gene families in draft genome assemblies. The program uses a pattern of short sequence motifs to identify putative genes directly from the genome sequence. Using a large gene family as a test case, Figmop was found to be more sensitive and specific than a BLAST-based approach. The visualization used allows the validation of potential genes to be carried out quickly and easily, saving hours if not days from an analysis.\nSource code of Figmop is freely available for download at https:\/\/github.com\/dave-the-scientist, implemented in C and Python and is supported on Linux, Unix and MacOSX.\ncurran.dave.m@gmail.com\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\u00a9 The Author 2014.

The patients within metastatic ccRCC have a poor 5-year survival rate that is less than 10%. It is essential to identify ccRCC -related genes to help with the understanding of molecular mechanism of ccRCC. In this literature, we aim to identify genes related to ccRCC based on a gene network. We collected gene expression level data of ccRCC from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for our analysis. We constructed a co-expression gene network as the first step of our study. Then, the network sparse boosting approach was performed to select the genes which are relevant to ccRCC. Results of our study show there are 15 genes selected from the all genes we collected. Among these genes, 7 of them have been demonstrated to play a key role in development and progression or in drug response of ccRCC. This finding offers clues of gene markers for the treatment of ccRCC.\n","451":"\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative movement disorder that primarily results due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region. Studying gene expression in the substantia nigra region would potentially unravel disease-relevant protein-protein interactions.\nIn this study we have used network science approach to prioritize candidate genes by focussing on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that interact with established PD associated-genes (PDAG). Prioritizing genes that interact with already established PDAG would reduce the probability of spurious protein-protein associations. The dataset GSE54282 with Parkinson's disease affected substantia nigra samples was extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Protein-Protein Interaction Network (PPIN) was constructed by retrieving all possible interactions between DEGs from high-throughput experiments and literature data using Bisogenet. This complex PPIN was decomposed to construct a subnetwork of Parkinson's Disease-Protein Interaction Map (PD-PIM) by including PDAG and following well-established concepts of network biology such as degree and betweenness centrality. We then implemented a \"two-way analysis\" where we selected genes belonging to PDPIM subnetwork with their primary interacting partners and highly coexpressed genes on the basis of Pearson score.\nA complex PPIN comprised of 5340 nodes (genes) and 39,199 edges (interactions) was obtained. A list of 205 genes (123 PDAGs, 69 hub genes and 13 bottleneck genes) with their respective first level interacting partners were extracted from PPIN interactome to build a PD-specific subnetwork, PD-PIM. This subnetwork PD-PIM comprised of 5078 nodes and 38,357 edges. We then employed a \"two-way\" gene prioritization method that delineated 267 genes of which 16 genes were found to intersect in the two networks of the \"two-way analysis\". Of the 16 genes, we narrowed down to 7 novel candidate genes (VCAM1, BACH1, CALM3, EGR1, IKBKE, MYC and YWHAG) displaying significant changes in their network interactions between control and disease samples. Interestingly, these genes were associated with neuroinflammation signaling pathway, MAPK signaling apoptosis pathway, movement disorders and development of neurons that are linked with development of PD.\nWe propose that VCAM1, BACH1, CALM3, EGR1, IKBKE, MYC and YWHAG genes might play important roles in PD pathogenesis, as well as facilitate the development of effective targeted therapies. Our integrative and network based approach for finding therapeutic targets in genomic data could accelerate the identification of novel drug targets for Parkinson's disease.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although some salt responsive genes have been identified in rice, their applications in developing salt tolerant cultivars have resulted in limited achievements. Herein, we used bioinformatic approaches to perform a meta-analysis of three transcriptome datasets from salinity and control conditions in order to reveal novel genes and the molecular pathways underlying rice response to salt. From a total of 28,432 expressed genes, we identify 457 core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) constitutively responding to salt, regardless of the stress duration, genotype, or the tissue. Gene co-expression analysis divided the core DEGs into three different modules, each of them contributing to salt response in a unique metabolic pathway. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses highlighted key biological processes and metabolic pathways involved in the salt response. We identified important novel hub genes encoding proteins of different families including CAM, DUF630\/632, DUF581, CHL27, PP2-13, LEA4-5, and transcription factors, which could be functionally characterized using reverse genetic experiments. This novel repertoire of candidate genes related to salt response in rice will be useful for engineering salt tolerant varieties.\n","453":"\nThe pepper weevil, Anthonomus eugenii Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is the main insect pest of peppers (Capsicum spp.) throughout the southern U.S. and a potential target for novel control methods that may require gene expression analyses. Careful selection of adequate reference genes to normalize RT-qPCR data is an important prerequisite for gene expression studies since the expression stability of reference genes can be affected by the experimental conditions leading to biased or erroneous results. The lack of studies on validation of reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in A. eugenii limits the investigation of gene expression, therefore it is needed a systematic selection of suitable reference genes for data normalization. In the present study, three programs (BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder) were used to analyze the expression stability of candidate reference genes (\u03b2-ACT, ArgK, EF1-\u03b1, GAPDH, RPL12, RPS23, \u03b1-TUB, 18S and 28S) in A. eugenii under different experimental conditions. Our results revealed that the most stably expressed reference genes in A. eugenii varied according to the experimental condition evaluated: developmental stages (EF1-\u03b1, 18S and RPL12), sex (RPS23 and RPL12), low temperature (GAPDH and \u03b1-TUB), high temperature (\u03b1-TUB and RPS23), all temperatures (\u03b1-TUB and GAPDH), starvation (RPL12 and \u03b1-TUB), and dsRNA exposure (\u03b1-TUB and RPL12). Our study provides for the first time valuable information on appropriate reference genes that can be used in the analysis of gene expression by RT-qPCR in biological experiments involving A. eugenii.\n","454":"\nGlobally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in females, with 1.4 million new cases and almost 694\u2009000 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2012. The development and progression of CRC is dictated by a series of alterations in diverse genes mostly proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. In this dreadful disease disturbances different from mutations called as epigenetic regulations are also taken into consideration and are thoroughly investigated. The present study was designed to analyze the promoter hypermethylation of CpG (cytosine, followed by guanine nucleotide) islands of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (P16) and O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) genes and its subsequent effect on the protein expression in CRC. The impact of the common functional polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, Val158Met, on promoter hypermethylation of P16 and MGMT genes in CRC was also investigated. The study included 200 CRC cases and equal numbers of normal samples. DNA was extracted using the kit method and methylation specific-PCR was performed for analysis of the promoter hypermethylation status. Total protein was isolated form all CRC cases and western blotting was performed for P16 and MGMT proteins. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism was analyzed by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Epigenetic analysis showed that unlike other high-risk regions, the Kashmiri population has a different promoter hypermethylation profile of both P16 and MGMT genes, with frequent and significant promoter hypermethylation of both in CRC. The frequency of promoter hypermethylation of both genes was significantly higher in males and was insignificantly found to be higher in stage III\/IV. The degree of P16 and MGMT promoter hypermethylation increased significantly with increasing severity of the lesion. We also found a significant correlation between P16 and MGMT promoter hypermethylation and loss of protein expression in CRC. A significant association was found between COMT polymorphism (homozygous variant) and P16 methylation status. Similar results were also found for MGMT hypermethylated cases.\n","455":"\nLentinula edodes is the most consumed mushroom in Asia due to its nutritional and medicinal values, and the optimal reference gene is crucial for normalization of its gene expression analysis. Here, the expression stability of 18 candidate reference genes (CRGs) in L. edodes was analyzed by three statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) under different stresses (heat, cadmium excess and Trichoderma atroviride infection), different substrates (straw, sawdust and corn stalk) and different development stages (mycelia, primordia and fruit bodies). Among the 18 CRGs, 28S, Actin and \u03b1-tub exhibited the highest expression stability in L. edodes under all conditions, while GPD, SPRYP and MSF showed the least stable expression. The best reference gene in different conditions was different. The pairwise variation values showed that two genes would be sufficient for accurate normalization under different conditions of L. edodes. This study will contribute to more accurate estimation of the gene relative expression levels under different conditions using the optimal reference gene in qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis.\n","456":"\nSuper-enhancer (SE)-associated oncogenes extensively potentiate the uncontrolled proliferation capacity of cancer cells. In this study, we aimed to identify the SE-associated hub genes associated with the clinical characteristics of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).\nEigengenes from CML clinical modules were determined using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Overlapping genes between eigengenes and SE-associated genes were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and annotate for pathway enrichment analysis. Expression patterns of the top-ranked SE-associated hub genes were further determined in CML patients and healthy controls via real-time PCR. After treatment of K562 cells with the BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1, for 24 hrs, mRNA and protein levels of SE-associated hub genes were evaluated using real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and BRD4 ChIP-seq signal peaks were used to predict and identify SEs visualized by the Integrative Genomics Viewer.\nThe yellow module was significantly related to the status and pathological phase of CML. SE-associated hub candidate genes were mainly enriched in the cell cycle pathway. Based on the PPI networks of hub genes and the top rank of degree, five SE-associated genes were identified: specifically, BUB1, CENPO, KIF2C, ORC1, and RRM2. Elevated expression of these five genes was not only related to CML status and phase but also positively regulated by SE and suppressed by the BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1, in K562 cells. Strong signal peaks of H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and BRD4 ChIP-seq of the five genes were additionally observed close to the predicted SE regions.\nThis is the first study to characterize SE-associated genes linked to clinical characteristics of CML via weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Our results support a novel mechanism involving aberrant expression of hub SE-associated genes in CML patients and K562 cells, and these genes will be potential new therapeutic targets for human leukemia.\n\u00a9 2019 Ma et al.\n","457":"\nPhosphofructokinase plays an essential role in sugar metabolism in plants. Plants possess two types of phosphofructokinase proteins for phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, the pyrophosphate-dependent fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase (PFP), and the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK). Until now, the gene evolution, expression patterns, and functions of phosphofructokinase proteins were unknown in pear. In this report, 14 phosphofructokinase genes were identified in pear. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the phosphofructokinase gene family could be grouped into two subfamilies, with 10 genes belonging to the PbPFK subfamily, and 4 genes belonging to the PbPFP subfamily. Conserved motifs and exon numbers of the phosphofructokinase were found in pear and other six species. The evolution analysis indicated that WGD\/Segmental and dispersed duplications were the main duplication models for the phosphofructokinase genes expansion in pear and other six species. Analysis of cis-regulatory element sequences of all phosphofructokinase genes identified light regulation and the MYB binding site in the promoter of all pear phosphofructokinase genes, suggesting that phosphofructokinase might could be regulated by light and MYB transcription factors (TFs). Gene expression patterns revealed that PbPFP1 showed similar pattern with sorbitol contents, suggesting important contributions to sugar accumulation during fruit development. Further functional analysis indicated that the phosphofructokinase gene PbPFP1 was localized on plasma membrane compartment, indicating that PbPFP1 had function in plasma membrane. Transient transformation of PbPFP1 in pear fruits led to significant increases of fructose and sorbitol compared to controls. Overall, our study provides important insights into the gene expression patterns and important potential functions of phosphofructokinase for sugar accumulation in pear fruits, which will help to enrich understanding of sugar-related bio-pathways and lay the molecular basis for fruit quality improvement.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, molecular oncology of GBM are urgently needed. In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression to identify key epigenetic genes in GBM. The methylation and gene expression of GBM patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were downloaded. After data preprocessing, we identified 4,881 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor and normal samples, including 1,111 upregulated and 3,770 downregulated genes. Then, we randomly separated all samples into training set (n = 69) and testing set (n = 69). We next obtained 11,269 survival-methylation sites by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. In the correlation analysis, we defined 198 low promoter methylation with high gene expression as epigenetically induced (EI) genes and 111 high promoter methylation with low gene expression as epigenetically suppressed (ES) genes. Key markers including C1orf61 and FAM50B were selected with a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.75. Further, we chose the 20 CpG methylation sites of above two genes in unsupervised clustering analysis using the Euclidean distance. We found that the prognosis of the hypomethylated group was significantly better than that in the hypermethylated group (log-rank test p-value = 0.011). Based on the validation in the TCGA testing set and GEO dataset, we validated the prognostic value of our signature (p-value = 0.02 in TCGA and 0.012 in GEO).

The molecular mechanisms of the initiation and progression of lung adenocarcinoma remain to be further determined. This study aimed to screen genes related to the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. By weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), we constructed a free-scale gene coexpression network to evaluate the correlations between multiple gene sets and patients' clinical traits, then further identify predictive biomarkers. GSE11969 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database which contained the gene expression data of 90 lung adenocarcinoma patients. Data of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were employed as the validation cohort. After the average linkage hierarchical clustering, a total of 9 modules were generated. In the clinical significant module (R\u2009=\u20090.44, P < 0.0001), we identified 29 network hub genes. Subsequent verification in the TCGA database showed that 11 hub genes (ANLN, CDCA5, FLJ21924, LMNB1, MAD2L1, RACGAP1, RFC4, SNRPD1, TOP2A, TTK, and ZWINT) were significantly associated with poor survival data of lung adenocarcinomas. Besides, the results of receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that the mRNA levels of this group of genes exhibited high specificity and sensitivity to distinguish malignant lesions from nonmalignant tissues. Apart from mRNA levels, we found that the protein abundances of these 11 genes were remarkably upregulated in lung adenocarcinomas compared with normal tissues. In conclusion, by the WGCNA method, a panel of 11 genes were identified as predictive biomarkers for tumorigenesis and poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinomas.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Ming Yi et al.\n","460":"\nGenetic investigations, boosted by modern sequencing techniques, allow dissecting the genetic component of different phenotypic traits.

RNA-sequencing data from Holstein and Jersey cows with high and low residual feed intake (RFI) and treated with two diets (low and high concentrate) were used. Approximately 26 million and 25 million pair reads were mapped to bovine reference genome for Jersey and Holstein breed, respectively. Subsequently, the gene count expressions data were analysed using a Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) approach. Functional enrichment analysis from Ingenuity\u00ae Pathway Analysis (IPA\u00ae), ClueGO application and STRING of these modules was performed to identify relevant biological pathways and regulatory genes.\nWGCNA identified two groups of co-expressed genes (modules) significantly associated with RFI and one module significantly associated with diet. In Holstein cows, the salmon module with module trait relationship (MTR)\u2009=\u20090.7 and the top upstream regulators ATP7B were involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism. The magenta module has been significantly associated (MTR\u2009=\u20090.51) with the treatment diet involved in the triglyceride homeostasis. In Jersey cows, the lightsteelblue1 (MTR\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.57) module controlled by IFNG and IL10RA was involved in the positive regulation of interferon-gamma production, lymphocyte differentiation, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity and primary immunodeficiency.\nThe present study provides new information on the biological functions in liver that are potentially involved in controlling feed efficiency. The hub genes and upstream regulators (ATP7b, IFNG and IL10RA) involved in these functions are potential candidate genes for the development of new biomarkers. However, the hub genes, upstream regulators and pathways involved in the co-expressed networks were different in both breeds.

The results of Gene Structure Display Serve and MEME revealed that BdPrxs in the same subgroup shared similar gene structure, and their protein sequences were highly conserved. Based on the analysis of evolutionary relationships and Ka\/Ks, 151 BdPrx genes were divided into 15 subgroups, they have undergone purifying selection. In addition, the result of GO annotation showed that 100% of the BdPrxs participated in antioxidant. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the orthology-based method, found that 66 BdPrxs were involved in the regulatory network and 183 network branches were identified. Furthermore, analysis of the transcriptome data indicated that the BdPrx genes responded to low concentration of exogenous phytohormones and exhibited different levels of expression in the different tissues. Subsequently, 19 genes were selected for quantitative real-time PCR and found to be mainly expressed in the roots, might preferentially respond to hydrogen peroxide and gibberellin.

Selection of suitable reference genes for quantification of target stress-responsive gene expression through quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR is important for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of improved stress tolerance. For precise normalization of gene expression data in pearl millet, ten candidate reference genes were examined in various developmental tissues as well as under different individual abiotic stresses and their combinations at 1\u2009h (early) and 24\u2009h (late) of stress using geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder algorithms. Our results revealed EF-1\u03b1 and UBC-E2 as the best reference genes across all samples, the specificity of which was confirmed by assessing the relative expression of a PgAP2 like-ERF gene that suggested use of these two reference genes is sufficient for accurate transcript normalization under different stress conditions. To our knowledge this is the first report on validation of reference genes under different individual and multiple abiotic stresses in pearl millet. The study can further facilitate fastidious discovery of stress-tolerance genes in this important stress-tolerant crop. \n","465":"\nPurine and pyrimidine analogues have important uses in chemotherapies against cancer, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that cause resistance to these drugs is therefore of importance in cancer treatment. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, overexpression of the HAM1 gene encoding inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase confers resistance to both the purine analogue 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) and the pyrimidine analogue 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Carlsson et al., 2013, PLoS One 8, e52094). To find out more about the mechanisms of resistance to nucleotide analogues, and possible interdependencies between purine and pyrimidine analogue resistance mechanisms, we screened a plasmid library in yeast for genes that confer HAP resistance when overexpressed. We cloned four such genes: ADE4, DUT1, APT2, and ATR1. We further looked for genetic interactions between these genes and genes previously found to confer resistance to 5-FU. We found that HMS1, LOG1 (YJL055W), HAM1, and ATR1 confer resistance to both 5-FU and HAP, whereas ADE4, DUT1 and APT2 are specific for HAP resistance, and CPA1 and CPA2 specific for 5-FU resistance. Possible mechanisms for 5-FU and HAP detoxification are discussed based on the observed genetic interactions. Based on the effect of LOG1 against both 5-FU and HAP toxicity, we propose that the original function of the LOG (LONELY GUY) family of proteins likely was to degrade non-canonical nucleotides, and that their role in cytokinin production is a later development in some organisms.\n","466":"\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy. Up till now, the patient's prognosis remains poor which, among others, is due to the paucity of reliable early diagnostic biomarkers. In the past, candidate diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets have been delineated from genes that were found to be differentially expressed in normal versus tumour samples. Recently, new systems biology approaches have been developed to analyse gene expression data, which may yield new biomarkers. As of yet, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) tool has not been applied to PDAC microarray-based gene expression data.\nPDAC microarray-based gene expression datasets, listed in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, were analysed. After pre-processing of the data, we built two final datasets, Normal and PDAC, encompassing 104 and 129 patient samples, respectively. Next, we constructed a weighted gene co-expression network and identified modules of co-expressed genes distinguishing normal from disease conditions. Functional annotations of the genes in these modules were carried out to highlight PDAC-associated molecular pathways and common regulatory mechanisms. Finally, overall survival analyses were carried out to assess the suitability of the genes identified as prognostic biomarkers.\nUsing WGCNA, we identified several key genes that may play important roles in PDAC. These genes are mainly related to either endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion or membrane functions, exhibit transferase or hydrolase activities and are involved in biological processes such as lipid metabolism or transmembrane transport. As a validation of the applied method, we found that some of the identified key genes (CEACAM1, MCU, VDAC1, CYCS, C15ORF52, TMEM51, LARP1 and ERLIN2) have previously been reported by others as potential PDAC biomarkers. Using overall survival analyses, we found that several of the newly identified genes may serve as biomarkers to stratify PDAC patients into low- and high-risk groups.\nUsing this new systems biology approach, we identified several genes that appear to be critical to PDAC development. As such, they may represent potential diagnostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets with clinical utility.\n","467":"\nHard ticks (family Ixodidae) are obligatory hematophagous ectoparasites of worldwide medical and veterinary importance. The haploid genomes of multiple species of ixodid ticks exceed 1 Gbp, prompting questions regarding gene, segmental and whole genome duplication in this phyletic group. The availability of the genome assembly for the black legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, and transcriptome datasets for multiple species of ticks offers an opportunity to assess the contribution of gene duplication to the genome. Here we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify and analyze duplicated genes (paralogs) using gene models from the prostriate tick, I. scapularis IscaW1.1 annotation and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from I. scapularis and the metastriate ticks, Rhipicephalus microplus (southern cattle tick), R. appendiculatus (brown ear tick) and Amblyomma variegatum (tropical bont tick).\nApproximately 1-2% of I. scapularis gene models and 2-14% of ESTs from the four species represent duplicated genes. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates suggests ~ 25% of duplicated genes are under positive selection pressure in each species. Analyses of synonymous substitution rates provide evidence for two duplication events in I. scapularis and R. microplus involving several hundred genes. Conservative molecular clock estimates based on synonymous substitution rates for species of Anopheles mosquitoes and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, suggest these events occurred within the last 50 MYA. Mapping of paralogs to the I. scapularis genome assembly supports tandem, or possibly segmental duplication events.\nThe present study marks the first genome-level analyses of gene duplication for the Ixodidae and provides insights into mechanisms shaping genome evolution in this group. At least two duplication events involving hundreds of genes may have occurred independently in the lineages prostriata and metastriata, with tandem and segmental duplication the most likely mechanisms for paralog generation. Duplicated genes under positive selection pressure may be linked to emerging functions in the tick and represent important candidates for further study.\n","468":"\nThe aim of this study was to identify key candidate genes in prostate cancer. The gene expression profiles of GSE32448, GSE45016, GSE46602 and GSE104749 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between prostate cancer and normal samples were identified by R language. The gene ontology functional and pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery software followed by the construction of protein-protein interaction network. Hub gene identification was performed by the plug-in cytoHubba in Cytoscape software. The 217 DEGs were significantly enriched in biological processes including epithelial cell differentiation, response to estradiol and several pathways, mainly associated with protein digestion and absorption pathway in prostate cancer. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule, twist family basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1, CD38 molecule and vascular endothelial growth factor A were identified as hub genes. The expression levels of hub genes were consistent with data obtained in The Cancer Genome Atlas for prostate adenocarcinoma. These hub genes may be used as potential targets for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n\u00a9 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.\n","469":"\nSelection of a suitable endogenous reference gene is essential for investigating expression of clock genes Bmal1, Clock, Pers, Crys, Rev-erb\u03b1\/\u03b2, and ROR\u03b1\/\u03b2\/\u03b3 involved in the circadian system. In this study, we treated rat ovary granulosa cells with dexamethasone to synchronize circadian oscillation in vitro and determined expression levels of Bmal1 and Per2 and six candidate reference genes (Actb, Beta actin; B2m, Beta-2-microglobulin; Ppia, Cyclophilin A; Gapdh, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Hprt, Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and Tbp, TATA-box-binding protein) using quantitative real-time PCR. We then employed three software programs, GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, to analyze the expression data for the selection of the best reference gene. According to GeNorm, Tbp and B2m were assessed as the most stable reference genes; Tbp and Hprt were best by NormFinder and BestKeeper, respectively. Thus, we recommend Tbp as the most suitable reference gene for studying clock genes expression in rat ovary granulosa cells in vitro.\n","470":"\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in xenobiotics metabolism (XM) are suspected to play a role in breast cancer risk. However, previous findings based on a SNP by SNP approach need to be replicated taking into account the combined effects of multiple SNPs. We used a gene-set analysis method to study the association between breast cancer risk and genetic variation in XM genes (seen as a set of SNPs) and in the XM pathway (seen as a set of genes). We also studied the interaction between variants in XM genes and tobacco smoking. The analysis was conducted in a case-control study of 1,125 cases and 1,172 controls. Using a dedicated chip, genotyping data of 585 SNPs in 68 XM genes were available. Genetic variation in the whole XM pathway was significantly associated with premenopausal breast cancer risk (p = 0.008). This association was mainly driven by genetic variation in NAT2, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, AKR1C2 and ALDH1A3. The association between the XM gene pathway and breast cancer was observed among current and previous smokers, but not among never smokers (p = 0.013 for interaction between XM genes and tobacco smoking status). The association with breast cancer risk indicates that XM genes variants may play a role in breast carcinogenesis through their detoxification function of environmental pollutants, such as those contained in tobacco smoke.\n\u00a9 2018 UICC.\n","471":"\nWood-decomposing fungi efficiently decompose plant lignocellulose, and there is increasing interest in characterizing and perhaps harnessing the fungal gene regulation strategies that enable wood decomposition. Proper interpretation of these fungal mechanisms relies on accurate quantification of gene expression, demanding reliable internal control genes (ICGs) as references. Commonly used ICGs such as actin, however, fluctuate among wood-decomposing fungi under defined conditions. In this study, by mining RNA-seq data in silico and validating ICGs in vitro using qRT-PCR, we targeted more reliable ICGs for studying transcriptional responses in wood-decomposing fungi, particularly responses to changing environments (e.g., carbon sources, decomposition stages) in various culture conditions. Using the model brown rot fungus Postia placenta in a first-pass study, our mining efforts yielded 15 constitutively-expressed genes robust in variable carbon sources (e.g., no carbon, glucose, cellobiose, aspen) and cultivation stages (e.g., 15\u202fh, 72\u202fh) in submerged cultures. Of these, we found 7 genes as most suitable ICGs. Expression stabilities of these newly selected ICGs were better than commonly used ICGs, analyzed by NormFinder algorithm and qRT-PCR. In a second-pass, multi-species study in solid wood, our RNA-seq mining efforts revealed hundreds of highly constitutively expressed genes among four wood-decomposing fungi with varying nutritional modes (brown rot, white rot), including a shared core set of ICGs numbering 11 genes. Together, the newly selected ICGs highlighted here will increase reliability when studying gene regulatory mechanisms of wood-decomposing fungi.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to characterize the transcriptomic features of LCIS and ILC, with a focus on the identification of intrinsic molecular subtypes of LCIS and the changes involved in the progression from normal breast epithelium to LCIS and ILC.\nFresh-frozen classic LCIS, classic ILC, and normal breast epithelium (N) from women undergoing prophylactic or therapeutic mastectomy were prospectively collected, laser-capture microdissected, and subjected to gene expression profiling using Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 microarrays.\nUnsupervised hierarchical clustering of 40 LCIS samples identified 2 clusters of LCIS distinguished by 6431 probe sets (p < 0.001). Genes identifying the clusters included proliferation genes and other genes related to cancer canonical pathways such as TGF beta signaling, p53 signaling, actin cytoskeleton, apoptosis and Wnt-Signaling pathway. A supervised analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (p < 0.001) between normal epithelium, LCIS, and ILC, using 23 patient-matched triplets of N, LCIS, and ILC, identified 169 candidate precursor genes, which likely play a role in LCIS progression, including PIK3R1, GOLM1, and GPR137B. These potential precursor genes map significantly more frequently to 1q and 16q, regions frequently targeted by gene copy number alterations in LCIS and ILC.\nHere we demonstrate that classic LCIS is a heterogeneous disease at the transcriptomic level and identify potential precursor genes in lobular carcinogenesis. Understanding the molecular heterogeneity of LCIS and the potential role of these potential precursor genes may help personalize the therapy of patients with LCIS.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Even if atresia involves apoptosis, its mechanism is not well understood. The objective of this study was to analyze global gene expression in pig granulosa cells of ovarian follicles during atresia. The transcriptome analysis was performed on a 9,216 cDNA microarray to identify gene networks and candidate genes involved in pig ovarian follicular atresia. We found 1,684 significantly regulated genes to be differentially regulated between small healthy follicles and small atretic follicles. Among them, 287 genes had a fold-change higher than two between the two follicle groups. Eleven genes (DKK3, GADD45A, CAMTA2, CCDC80, DAPK2, ECSIT, MSMB, NUPR1, RUNX2, SAMD4A, and ZNF628) having a fold-change higher than five between groups could likely serve as markers of follicular atresia. Moreover, automatic confrontation of deregulated genes with literature data highlighted 93 genes as regulatory candidates of pig granulosa cell atresia. Among these genes known to be inhibitors of apoptosis, stimulators of apoptosis, or tumor suppressors INHBB, HNF4, CLU, different interleukins (IL5, IL24), TNF-associated receptor (TNFR1), and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) were suggested as playing an important role in porcine atresia. The present study also enlists key upstream regulators in follicle atresia based on our results and on a literature review. The novel gene candidates and gene networks identified in the current study lead to a better understanding of the molecular regulation of ovarian follicular atresia.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 the American Physiological Society.\n","474":"\nDifferent mechanisms regulate the expression level of tissue specific genes in human.

This study analyzed gene expression of this bacterium during growth in whole egg, and whether highly expressed genes were essential for the growth. High quality RNA was extracted from S. Enteritidis using a modified RNA-extraction protocol. Global gene expression during growth in whole egg was compared to growth in LB-medium using DNA array method. Twenty-six genes were significantly upregulated during growth in egg; these belonged to amino acid biosynthesis, di\/oligopeptide transport system, biotin synthesis, ferrous iron transport system, and type III secretion system. Significant downregulation of 15 genes related to formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) and trehalose metabolism was observed. The results suggested that S. Enteritidis is starved for amino-acids, biotin and iron when growing in egg. However, site specific mutation of amino acid biosynthesis genes asnA (17.3 fold upregulated), asnB (18.6 fold upregulated), asnA\/asnB and, serA (12.0 fold upregulated) and gdhA (3.7 fold upregulated), did not result in growth attenuation, suggesting that biosynthesis using the enzymes encoded from these genes may represent the first choice for S.

One or more appropriate reference genes must be selected to accurately compare mRNA transcript levels across different samples and tissues. The freshwater pearl, Hyriopsis cumingii (Lea), is an important economic species cultured in China. To date, no reference genes for gene expression analysis in this species have been validated. This study aimed to compare the relative expression of seven housekeeping genes across different tissue types and in the mantle or pearl sac during three biomineralization processes: seasonal shell growth, shell healing and pearl-sac formation in H. cumingii. Three programs evaluated the expression stabilities of the seven genes: BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder. The beta actin gene (ACTB), commonly used as a housekeeping gene in many studies, was the least stable. The expressions of Ubiquitin (Ubi) and Ribosomal protein L18 (Rpl18) and Elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1\u03b1) were more stable than the remaining four genes. Therefore, we suggest that Ubi, Rpl18 and EF1\u03b1 are suitable reference genes. The three selected reference genes are expected to facilitate analysis of gene expressions during shell or pearl formation in H. cumingii. \n","477":"\nThe RNA interference pathway in the protist Entamoeba histolytica plays important roles in permanent gene silencing as well as in the regulation of virulence determinants. Recently, a novel RNA interference (RNAi)-based silencing technique was developed in this parasite that uses a gene endogenously silenced by small RNAs as a \"trigger\" to induce silencing of other genes that are fused to it. Fusion to a trigger gene induces the production of gene-specific antisense small RNAs, resulting in robust and permanent silencing of the cognate gene. This approach has silenced multiple genes including those involved in virulence and transcriptional regulation. We now demonstrate that all tested genes of the amebic RNAi pathway are unable to be silenced using the trigger approach, including Argonaute genes (Ago2-1, Ago2-2, and Ago2-3), RNaseIII, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). In all situations (except for RdRP), fusion to a trigger successfully induces production of gene-specific antisense small RNAs to the cognate gene. These small RNAs are capable of silencing a target gene in trans, indicating that they are functional; despite this, however, they cannot silence the RNAi pathway genes. Interestingly, when a trigger is fused to RdRP, small RNA induction to RdRP does not occur, a unique phenotype hinting that either RdRP is highly resistant to being a target of small RNAs or that small RNA generation may be controlled by RdRP. The inability of the small RNA pathway to silence RNAi genes in E. histolytica, despite the generation of functional small RNAs to these loci suggest that epigenetic factors may protect certain genomic loci and thus determine susceptibility to small RNA mediated silencing. \n","478":"\nWheat grain development is a robust biological process that largely determines grain quality and yield. In this study, we investigated the grain transcriptome of winter wheat cv. Xiaoyan-6 at four developmental stages (5, 10, 15, and 20\u00a0days post-anthesis), using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We identified 427 grain-specific transcription factors (TFs) and 1653 differentially expressed TFs during grain development as well as a grain co-expression regulation network (GrainNet) of the TFs and their predicted co-expressed genes. Our study identified ten putative key TFs and the predicted regulatory genes of these TFs in wheat grain development of Xiaoyan-6. The analysis was given a firm basis through the study of additional wheat tissues, including root, stem, leaf, flag leaf, grain, spikes (from wheat plants at booting or heading stages) to provide a dataset of 92,478 high-confidence protein-coding genes that were mostly evenly distributed among subgenomes, but unevenly distributed across each of the chromosomes or each of the seven homeologous groups. Within this larger framework of the transcriptomes, we identified 4659 grain-specific genes (SEGs) and 26,500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) throughout grain development stages tested. The SEGs identified mainly associate with regulation and signaling-related biological processes, while the DEGs mainly involve in cellular component organization or biogenesis and nutrient reservoir activity during grain development of Xiaoyan-6.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are high penetrance genes associated with an increased risk of up to 20-fold for breast and ovarian cancer. However, only 20-30% of HBOC cases present pathogenic variants in those genes, and other DNA repair genes have emerged as increasing the risk for HBOC. In Brazil, variants in ATM, ATR, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, POLQ, PTEN, and TP53 genes have been reported in up to 7.35% of the studied cases. Here we screened and characterized variants in 21 DNA repair genes in HBOC patients.\nWe systematically analyzed 708 amplicons encompassing the coding and flanking regions of 21 genes related to DNA repair pathways (ABRAXAS1, ATM, ATR, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, MLH1, MRE11, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51, TP53 and UIMC1). A total of 95 individuals with HBOC syndrome clinical suspicion in Southeast Brazil were sequenced, and 25 samples were evaluated for insertions\/deletions in BRCA1\/BRCA2 genes. Identified variants were assessed in terms of population allele frequency and their functional effects were predicted through in silico algorithms.\nWe identified 80 variants in 19 genes. About 23.4% of the patients presented pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53, a frequency higher than that identified among previous studies in Brazil. We identified a novel variant in ATR, which was predicted as pathogenic by in silico tools. The association analysis revealed 13 missense variants in ABRAXAS1, BARD1, BRCA2, CHEK2, CDH1, MLH1, PALB2, and PMS2 genes, as significantly associated with increased risk to HBOC, and the patients carrying those variants did not present large insertions or deletions in BRCA1\/BRCA2 genes.\nThis study embodies the third report of a multi-gene analysis in the Brazilian population, and addresses the first report of many germline variants associated with HBOC in Brazil. Although further functional analyses are necessary to better characterize the contribution of those variants to the phenotype, these findings would improve the risk estimation and clinical follow-up of patients with HBOC clinical suspicion.\n","480":"\nReverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a reliable technique for quantifying expression levels of targeted genes during various biological processes in numerous areas of clinical and biological research. Selection of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization is an elementary prerequisite for reliable measurements of gene expression levels. Here, by analyzing datasets published between 2008 and 2017, we summarized the current trends in reference gene selection for insect gene expression studies that employed the most widely used SYBR Green method for RT-qPCR normalization. We curated 90 representative papers, mainly published in 2013-2017, in which a total of 78 insect species were investigated in 100 experiments. Furthermore, top five journals, top 10 frequently used reference genes, and top 10 experimental factors have been determined. The relationships between the numbers of the reference genes, experimental factors, analysis tools on the one hand and publication date (year) on the other hand was investigated by linear regression. We found that the more recently the paper was published, the more experimental factors it tended to explore, and more analysis tools it used. However, linear regression analysis did not reveal a significant correlation between the number of reference genes and the study publication date. Taken together, this meta-analysis will be of great help to researchers that plan gene expression studies in insects, especially the non-model ones, as it provides a summary of appropriate reference genes for expression studies, considers the optimal number of reference genes, and reviews the average number of experimental factors and analysis tools per study.\n","481":"\nThe aim of the present study was to reveal the potential hub genes and regulatory mechanisms associated with senescence in human annulus cells by analyzing microarray data using bioinformatics. The gene expression dataset GSE17077, of senescent and non\u2011senescent annulus cells obtained from patients with disc degenerative diseases (DDD), was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Functional and pathway annotations were performed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes terms, respectively. Web\u2011based Gene Set Analysis Toolkit and Chip Enrichment Analysis were used to identify key transcription factors (TFs).

A total of 667 DEGs were screened, including 368 up\u2011 and 299 down\u2011regulated genes. These DEGs were enriched in phosphorylation, regulation of apoptosis and regulation of programmed cell death. In addition, DEGs were involved in axon guidance, natural killer cell\u2011mediated cytotoxicity, purine metabolism and the mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.

Selection of suitable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR is important for normalizing the expression of the key genes associated with various stresses. To validate suitable reference genes, we selected 11 candidate reference genes (five traditional housekeeping genes and six novel genes) and analyzed their expression stability in various samples, including different tissues and under different abiotic stress treatments. The expression of these genes was determined using five programs-geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, \u0394Ct, and RefFinder. The results showed that \u03b1-TUB2 (alpha-tubulin 2) and DnaJ (chaperone protein DnaJ 49) were the most stable reference genes across all the tested samples. We measured the expression profiles of the defense response gene SmCAT (catalase) using the two most stable and one least stable reference genes in all samples of S. matsudana. The relative quantification of SmCAT varied greatly according to the different reference genes. We propose that \u03b1-TUB2 and DnaJ should be the preferred reference genes for normalization and quantification of transcript levels in future gene expression studies in willow species under various abiotic stress conditions.\n","484":"\nQuantitative analysis of gene expression is a fundamental experimental approach in many fields of plant biology, but it requires the use of internal controls representing constitutively expressed genes for reliable transcript quantification. In this study, we identified fifteen putative reference genes from an A. angustifolia transcriptome database. Variation in transcript levels was first evaluated in silico by comparing read counts and then by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), resulting in the identification of six candidate genes. The consistency of transcript abundance was also calculated applying geNorm and NormFinder software packages followed by a validation approach using four target genes. The results presented here indicate that a diverse set of samples should ideally be used in order to identify constitutively expressed genes, and that the use of any two reference genes in combination, of the six tested genes, is sufficient for effective expression normalization.

Therefore, 12 candidate reference genes were selected from the V. volvacea transcriptome based on previous studies and then BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder were used to identify reference genes stably expressed during different developmental stages and conditions. Of the 12 candidate reference genes, SPRY domain protein (SPRYp), alpha-tubulin (TUB\u03b1), cyclophilin (CYP), L-asparaginase (L-asp), and MSF1-domain-containing protein (MSF1) were the most stably expressed under different experimental conditions, while 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S), and beta-actin (ACTB) were the least stably expressed.

Understanding gene regulatory relationships during male reproductive development is essential for fundamental biology and crop breeding. In this work, we developed a rice gene co-expression network for anther development (RiceAntherNet) that allows prediction of gene regulatory relationships during pollen development. RiceAntherNet was generated from 57 rice anther tissue microarrays across all developmental stages. The microarray datasets from nine rice male sterile mutants, including msp1-4, ostdl1a, gamyb-2, tip2, udt1-1, tdr, eat1-1, ptc1 and mads3-4, were used to explore and test the network. Among the changed genes, three clades showing differential expression patterns were constructed to identify genes associated with pollen formation. Many of these have known roles in pollen development, for example, seven genes in Clade 1 (OsABCG15, OsLAP5, OsLAP6, DPW, CYP703A3, OsNP1 and OsCP1) are involved in rice pollen wall formation. Furthermore, Clade 1 contained 12 genes whose predicted orthologs in Arabidopsis have been reported as key during pollen development and may play similar roles in rice. Genes in Clade 2 are expressed earlier than Clade 1 (anther stages 2-9), while genes in Clade 3 are expressed later (stages 10-12). RiceAntherNet serves as a valuable tool for identifying novel genes during plant anther and pollen development. A website is provided (https:\/\/www.cpib.ac.uk\/anther\/riceindex.html) to present the expression profiles for gene characterization. This will assist in determining the key relationships between genes, thus enabling characterization of critical genes associated with anther and pollen regulatory networks.\n\u00a9 2017 The Authors The Plant Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for Experimental Biology.\n","487":"\nQuantitative real time (qRT)-PCR is a precise and efficient method for studying gene expression changes between two states of interest, and is frequently used for validating interesting gene expression patterns in candidate genes initially identified in genome-wide expression analyses, such as RNA-seq experiments. For an adequate normalisation of qRT-PCR data, it is essential to have reference genes available whose expression intensities are constant among the different states of interest. In this study we present and validate a catalogue of traditional and newly identified reference genes that were selected from RNA-seq data from multiple individuals from the dioecious plant Silene latifolia with the aim of studying gene expression differences between the two sexes in both reproductive and vegetative tissues. The catalogue contains more than 15 reference genes with both stable expression intensities and a range of expression intensities in flower buds and leaf tissues. These reference genes were used to normalize expression differences between reproductive and vegetative tissues in eight candidate genes with sex-biased expression. Our results suggest a trend towards a reduced sex-bias in sex-linked gene expression in vegetative tissues. In this study, we report on the systematic identification and validation of internal reference genes for adequate normalization of qRT-PCR-based analyses of gene expression differences between the two sexes in S. latifolia. We also show how RNA-seq data can be used efficiently to identify suitable reference genes in a wide diversity of species. \n","488":"\nThe HIN-200 family genes in humans have been linked to several autoimmune diseases-particularly to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, its human counterpart gene cluster, the Ifi200 family in mice, has been linked to spontaneous arthritis disease (SAD). However, many immune-mediated diseases (including RA and SLE) show gender difference. Understanding whether or not and how these genes play a role in sex difference in immune-mediated diseases is essential for diagnosis\/treatment.\nThis study takes advantage of the whole genome gene expression profiles of recombinant inbred (RI) strain populations from female and male mice to analyze potential sex differences in a variety of genes in disease pathways. Expression levels and regulatory QTL of Ifi200 family genes between female and male mice were first examined in a large mouse population, including RI strains derived from C57BL\/6J, DBA\/2J (BXD), and classic inbred strains. Sex similarities and differences were then analyzed for correlations with gene expression levels between genes in the Ifi200 family and four selected gene sets: known immune Ifi200 pathway-related genes, lupus-relevant genes, osteoarthritis- (OA-) and RA-relevant genes, and sex hormone-related genes.\nThe expression level of Ifi202b showed the most sex difference in correlation with known immune-related genes (the P value for Ifi202b is 0.0004). Ifi202b also showed gender difference in correlation with selected sex hormone genes, with a P value of 0.0243. When comparing coexpression levels between Ifi200 genes and lupus-relevant genes, Ifi203 and Ifi205 showed significant sex difference (P values: 0.0303 and 0.002, resp.). Furthermore, several key genes (e.g., Csf1r, Ifnb1, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, Jhdm1d, Csf1r, Ifnb1, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and Tgfb2 that regulate sex differences in immune diseases) were discovered.\nDifferent genes in the Ifi200 family play different roles in sex difference among dissimilar pathways of these four gene groups.\n","489":"\nSeveral fruit flies species of the Anastrepha fraterculus group are of great economic importance for the damage they cause to a variety of fleshy fruits. Some species in this group have diverged recently, with evidence of introgression, showing similar morphological attributes that render their identification difficult, reinforcing the relevance of identifying new molecular markers that may differentiate species. We investigated genes expressed in head tissues from two closely related species: A. obliqua and A. fraterculus, aiming to identify fixed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and highly differentiated transcripts, which, considering that these species still experience some level of gene flow, could indicate potential candidate genes involved in their differentiation process. We generated multiple libraries from head tissues of these two species, at different reproductive stages, for both sexes. Our analyses indicate that the de novo transcriptome assemblies are fairly complete. We also produced a hybrid assembly to map each species' reads, and identified 67,470 SNPs in A. fraterculus, 39,252 in A. obliqua, and 6386 that were common to both species. We identified 164 highly differentiated unigenes that had a mean interspecific index ([Formula: see text]) of at least 0.94. We selected unigenes that had Ka\/Ks higher than 0.5, or had at least three or more highly differentiated SNPs as potential candidate genes for species differentiation. Among these candidates, we identified proteases, regulators of redox homeostasis, and an odorant-binding protein (Obp99c), among other genes. The head transcriptomes described here enabled the identification of thousands of genes hitherto unavailable for these species, and generated a set of candidate genes that are potentially important to genetically identify species and understand the speciation process in the presence of gene flow of A. obliqua and A. fraterculus.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Rezende et al.\n","490":"\nPlants are exposed to pathogens around the clock. A common resistance response in plants upon pathogen detection is localized cell death. Given the irreversible nature of this response, multiple layers of negative regulation are present to prevent the untimely or misexpression of resistance genes. One layer of negative regulation is provided by a recently discovered microRNA (miRNA) gene family, miR482\/2118. This family targets the transcripts of resistance genes in plants. We investigated the evolutionary history and specificity of this miRNA gene family within the Solanaceae. This plant family includes many important crop species, providing a set of well-defined resistance gene repertoires. Across 14 species from the Solanaceae, we identified eight distinct miR482\/2118 gene family members. Our studies show conservation of miRNA type and number in the group of wild tomatoes and, to a lesser extent, throughout the Solanaceae. The eight orthologous miRNA gene clusters evolved under different evolutionary constraints, allowing for individual subfunctionalization of the miRNAs. Despite differences in the predicted targeting behavior of each miRNA, the miRNA-R-gene network is robust due to its high degree of interconnectivity and redundant targeting. Our data suggest that the miR482\/2118 gene family acts as an evolutionary buffer for R-gene sequence diversity. \n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015.

However, there have been limited reports on the exploration of new biomarkers of ES. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify the potential hub genes associated with overall vital survival (OVS) and metastasis in ES. Traditional methods for identifying differentially expressed genes lack the in-depth information of mechanistic studies. In this study, a weighted co-expression network for ES was constructed through weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify co-expression modules associated with clinical phenotypes. The hub genes in the metastasis- and OVS-related co-expression modules were extracted, and the association between the hub genes and patient OVS was verified in another independent Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. Functional annotations and protein-protein interaction analysis of co-expression modules were also used to understand the potential regulatory mechanisms. The results of the functional enrichment analysis revealed that the OVS-associated module was mainly enriched in the cell cycle and immune response, and the metastasis-associated module was enriched in metabolism. A total of four genes (proteasome subunit \u03b14, L1 cell adhesion molecule, serine\/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) in the OVS-related module and two genes (calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit \u03b32 and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2) in the metastasis-related module were selected as hub genes. Further research on the hub genes identified in the present study may contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of ES metastasis and progression.\n","492":"\nCell-to-cell variation in gene expression increases among homologous cells within multiple tissues during aging. We call this phenomenon variegated gene expression (VGE). Long, healthy life requires robust and coordinated gene expression. We posit that nature may have evolved VGE as a bet-hedging mechanism to protect reproductively active populations. The price we may pay is accelerated aging. That hypothesis will require the demonstration that genetic loci are capable of modulating degrees of VGE. While loci controlling VGE in yeast and genes controlling inter-individual variation in gene expression in C. elegans have been identified, there has been no compelling evidence for the role of specific genetic loci in modulations of VGE of specific targets in humans. With the assistance of a core facility, we used a customized library of siRNA constructs to screen 1,195 human genes to identify loci contributing to the control of VGE of a gene with relevance to the biology of aging. We identified approximately 50 loci controlling VGE of the prolongevity gene, SIRT1. Because of its partial homology to FOXO3A, a variant of which is enriched in centenarians, our lab independently confirmed that the knockdown of FOXF2 greatly diminished VGE of SIRT1 but had little impact upon the VGE of WRN. While the role of these VGE-altering genes on aging in vivo remains to be determined, we hypothesize that some of these genes can be targeted to increase functionality during aging.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

It is therefore urgent to identify specific genes and pathways associated with its progression and prognosis.\nThe differentially expressed genes in The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed to build the co-expression network by Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Gene ontology (GO) as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were conducted for the selected genes. Module-clinical trait relationships were analyzed to explore the association with clinicopathological parameters. Log-rank tests and cox regression were used to identify the prognosis-related genes.\nThe most related modules with CCA development were tan module containing 181 genes and salmon module with 148 genes.

Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is one of the most common methods used for quantification of miRNA expression, and the levels of expression are normalized by comparing with reference genes. Thus, the selection of reference genes is critically important for accurate quantification. The present study was intended to identify appropriate miRNA reference genes for normalizing the level of miRNA expression in Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck and Citrus reticulata Blanco infected by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, which caused citrus canker disease. Five algorithms (Delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder) were used for screening reference genes, and two quantification approaches, poly(A) extension RT-qPCR and stem-loop RT-qPCR, were used to determine the most appropriate method for detecting expression patterns of miRNA. An overall comprehensive ranking output derived from the multi-algorithms showed that poly(A)-tailed miR162-3p\/miR472 were the best reference gene combination for miRNA RT-qPCR normalization in citrus canker research. Candidate reference gene expression profiles determined by poly(A) RT-qPCR were more consistent in the two citrus species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic comparison of two miRNA quantification methods for evaluating reference genes. These results highlight the importance of rigorously assessing candidate reference genes and clarify some contradictory results in miRNA research on citrus.\n","497":"\nDespite moderate heritability estimates, the molecular architecture of aggressive behavior remains poorly characterized. This study compared gene expression profiles from a genetic mouse model of aggression with zebrafish, an animal model traditionally used to study aggression. A meta-analytic, cross-species approach was used to identify genomic variants associated with aggressive behavior. The Rankprod algorithm was used to evaluated mRNA differences from prefrontal cortex tissues of three sets of mouse lines (N\u2009=\u200918) selectively bred for low and high aggressive behavior (SAL\/LAL, TA\/TNA, and NC900\/NC100). The same approach was used to evaluate mRNA differences in zebrafish (N\u2009=\u200912) exposed to aggressive or non-aggressive social encounters. Results were compared to uncover genes consistently implicated in aggression across both studies. Seventy-six genes were differentially expressed (PFP\u2009<\u20090.05) in aggressive compared to non-aggressive mice. Seventy genes were differentially expressed in zebrafish exposed to a fight encounter compared to isolated zebrafish. Seven genes (Fos, Dusp1, Hdac4, Ier2, Bdnf, Btg2, and Nr4a1) were differentially expressed across both species 5 of which belonging to a gene-network centred on the c-Fos gene hub. Network analysis revealed an association with the MAPK signaling cascade. In human studies HDAC4 haploinsufficiency is a key genetic mechanism associated with brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome (BDMR), which is associated with aggressive behaviors. Moreover, the HDAC4 receptor is a drug target for valproic acid, which is being employed as an effective pharmacological treatment for aggressive behavior in geriatric, psychiatric, and brain-injury patients. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","498":"\nWhole-genome duplication events (polyploidy events) and gene loss events have played important roles in the evolution of legumes. Here we show that the vast majority of Hsf gene duplications resulted from whole genome duplication events rather than tandem duplication, and significant differences in gene retention exist between species. By searching for intraspecies gene colinearity (microsynteny) and dating the age distributions of duplicated genes, we found that genome duplications accounted for 42 of 46 Hsf-containing segments in Glycine max, while paired segments were rarely identified in Lotus japonicas, Medicago truncatula and Cajanus cajan. However, by comparing interspecies microsynteny, we determined that the great majority of Hsf-containing segments in Lotus japonicas, Medicago truncatula and Cajanus cajan show extensive conservation with the duplicated regions of Glycine max. These segments formed 17 groups of orthologous segments. These results suggest that these regions shared ancient genome duplication with Hsf genes in Glycine max, but more than half of the copies of these genes were lost. On the other hand, the Glycine max Hsf gene family retained approximately 75% and 84% of duplicated genes produced from the ancient genome duplication and recent Glycine-specific genome duplication, respectively. Continuous purifying selection has played a key role in the maintenance of Hsf genes in Glycine max. Expression analysis of the Hsf genes in Lotus japonicus revealed their putative involvement in multiple tissue-\/developmental stages and responses to various abiotic stimuli.

In Chile, the freshwater silverside fish Basilichthys microlepidotus inhabits both polluted and nonpolluted areas, showing differential gene expression related to pollution. In this study, we infer the stability of six potential reference genes (tubulin alpha, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, 60S ribosomal protein L13, and 60S ribosomal protein L8) in the gills and liver of silverside individuals inhabiting polluted and nonpolluted areas. To validate the reference genes selected, the most and least stable reference genes were used to normalize two target transcripts, one for each organ. The RefFinder tool was used to analyze and identify the most stably expressed genes. The 60S ribosomal protein L8 gene was ranked as the most stable gene for both organs.

The Gene Commanding Height (GCH), a measure that combines the expression control and expression correlation with all other genes, is used to establish the gene hierarchy in each cell phenotype. We developed the experimental protocol, the mathematical algorithm and the computer software to identify the GMRs from transcriptomic data in surgically removed tumors, biopsies or blood from cancer patients. The GMR approach is illustrated with applications to our microarray data on human kidney, thyroid and prostate cancer samples, and on thyroid, prostate and blood cancer cell lines. We proved experimentally that each patient has his\/her own GMRs, that cancer nuclei and surrounding normal tissue are governed by different GMRs, and that manipulating the expression has larger consequences for genes with higher GCH.

Global analyses of gene expression levels are useful for cataloging genes and correlated phenotypes, and for elucidating the role of genes in maladies. Comparative expression of gene networks coupled to complex disorders can contribute insights as to how \"modifier genes\" influence the expressed phenotypes. Increasingly, a more comprehensive and detailed systematic understanding of genetic abnormalities underlying, for example, various genetic cardiomyopathies is emerging. Implementing genomic findings in cardiology practice may well lead directly to better diagnosing and therapeutics. There is currently evolving a strong appreciation for the value of studying gene anomalies, and doing so in a non-disjointed, cohesive manner. However, it is challenging for many-practitioners and investigators-to comprehend, interpret, and utilize the clinically increasingly accessible and affordable cardiovascular genomics studies. This survey addresses the need for fundamental understanding in this vital area. \n","509":"\nInteractions between genes can influence how selection acts on sequence variation. In gene regulatory networks, genes that affect the expression of many other genes may be under stronger evolutionary constraint than genes whose expression affects fewer partners. While this has been studied for individual tissue types, we know less about the effects of regulatory networks on gene evolution across different tissue types. We use RNA-sequencing and genomic data collected from Mus musculus domesticus to construct and compare gene co-expression networks for 10 tissue types. We identify tissue-specific expression and local regulatory variation, and we associate these components of gene expression variation with sequence polymorphism and divergence. We found that genes with higher connectivity across tissues and genes associated with a greater number of cross-tissue modules showed significantly lower genetic diversity and lower rates of protein evolution. Consistent with this pattern, \"hub\" genes across multiple tissues also showed evidence of greater evolutionary constraint. Using allele-specific expression, we found that genes with cis-regulatory variation had lower average connectivity and higher levels of tissue specificity. Taken together, these results are consistent with strong purifying selection acting on genes with high connectivity within and across tissues.\n","510":"\nBreast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies that could threaten female health. As the molecular mechanism of BC has not yet been completely discovered, identification of related genes of this disease is an important area of research that could provide new insights into gene function as well as potential treatment targets. Here we used subnetwork extraction algorithms to identify novel BC related genes based on the known BC genes (seed genes), gene co-expression profiles and protein-protein interaction network. We computationally predicted seven key genes (EPHX2, GHRH, PPYR1, ALPP, KNG1, GSK3A and TRIT1) as putative genes of BC. Further analysis shows that six of these have been reported as breast cancer associated genes, and one (PPYR1) as cancer associated gene. Lastly, we developed an expression signature using these seven key genes which significantly stratified 1660 BC patients according to relapse free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.65; Logrank p = 5.5e-13). The 7-genes signature could be established as a useful predictor of disease prognosis in BC patients. Overall, the identified seven genes might be useful prognostic and predictive molecular markers to predict the clinical outcome of BC patients.\n","511":"\nIn microarray data, wide-scale correlations are numerous and increase the number of genes correlated to a test condition (phenotype, mutation status, etc.) either positively or negatively. Several methods have been developed to limit the effect of such correlations on the false discovery rate, but these may reject too many genes that have a mild or indirect impact on the studied condition. We propose here a simple methodology to correct this spurious effect without eliminating weak but true correlations.\nThis methodology was applied to a microarray dataset designed to distinguish heterozygous BRCA1 mutation carriers from non-carriers. As our samples were collected at different times in the morning, we evaluated the effect of correlations due to circadian rhythm. The circadian system is a well-known correlation network, regulated by a small number of period genes whose expression varies throughout the day in predictable ways. The downstream effects of this variation on the expression of other genes, however, are incompletely characterized. We used two different strategies to correct this correlation bias, by either dividing or multiplying the expression of correlated genes by the expression of the considered period gene according to the sign of the correlation between the period gene and correlated gene (respectively positive or negative).\nWe observed a linear relationship between the number of false-positive\/negative genes and the strength of the correlation of the candidate gene to the test condition. BRCA1 was highly correlated to the period gene Per1; our correction methodology enabled us to recover genes coding for BRCA1-interacting proteins which were not selected in the initial direct analysis. This methodology may be valuable for other studies and can be applied very easily in case of well-known correlation networks.\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Seven years after sequencing the cattle genome, there are still genes that have limited annotation and the function of many genes are still not understood, or partly understood at best. Based on the assumption that genes with similar patterns of expression across a vast array of tissues and experimental conditions are likely to encode proteins with related functions or participate within a given pathway, we constructed a genome-wide Cattle Gene Co-expression Network (CGCN) using 72 microarray datasets that contained a total of 1470 Affymetrix Genechip Bovine Genome Arrays that were retrieved from either NCBI GEO or EBI ArrayExpress.\nThe total of 16,607 probe sets, which represented 11,397 genes, with unique Entrez ID were consolidated into 32 co-expression modules that contained between 29 and 2569 probe sets. All of the identified modules showed strong functional enrichment for gene ontology (GO) terms and Reactome pathways. For example, modules with important biological functions such as response to virus, response to bacteria, energy metabolism, cell signaling and cell cycle have been identified. Moreover, gene co-expression networks using \"guilt-by-association\" principle have been used to predict the potential function of 132 genes with no functional annotation. Four unknown Hub genes were identified in modules highly enriched for GO terms related to leukocyte activation (LOC509513), RNA processing (LOC100848208), nucleic acid metabolic process (LOC100850151) and organic-acid metabolic process (MGC137211). Such highly connected genes should be investigated more closely as they likely to have key regulatory roles.\nWe have demonstrated that the CGCN and its corresponding regulons provides rich information for experimental biologists to design experiments, interpret experimental results, and develop novel hypothesis on gene function in this poorly annotated genome.

Identification of essential genes helps us to understand the underlying mechanism of cell life. The essential genes of bacteria are potential drug targets of some diseases genes. Recently, several computational methods have been proposed to detect essential genes based on the static protein\u207bprotein interactive (PPI) networks. However, these methods have ignored the fact that essential genes play essential roles under certain conditions. In this work, a novel method was proposed for the identification of essential proteins by fusing the dynamic PPI networks of different time points (called by FDP). Firstly, the active PPI networks of each time point were constructed and then they were fused into a final network according to the networks' similarities. Finally, a novel centrality method was designed to assign each gene in the final network a ranking score, whilst considering its orthologous property and its global and local topological properties in the network. This model was applied on two different yeast data sets. The results showed that the FDP achieved a better performance in essential gene prediction as compared to other existing methods that are based on the static PPI network or that are based on dynamic networks.\n","514":"\nThe agglutinin-like sequence (Als) proteins are best-characterized in Candida albicans and known for their role in adhesion of the fungal cell to host and abiotic surfaces. ALS sequences are often misassembled in whole-genome sequence data because each species has multiple ALS loci that contain similar sequences, most notably tandem copies of highly conserved repeated sequences. The Candida parapsilosis species complex includes Candida parapsilosis, Candida orthopsilosis, and Candida metapsilosis, three distinct but closely related species. Using publicly available genome resources, de novo genome assemblies, and laboratory experimentation including Sanger sequencing, five ALS genes were characterized in C. parapsilosis strain CDC317, three in C. orthopsilosis strain 90-125, and four in C. metapsilosis strain ATCC 96143. The newly characterized ALS genes shared similar features with the well-known C. albicans ALS family, but also displayed unique attributes such as novel short, imperfect repeat sequences that were found in other genes encoding fungal cell-wall proteins. Evidence of recombination between ALS sequences and other genes was most obvious in CmALS2265, which had the 5' end of an ALS gene and the repeated sequences and 3' end from the IFF\/HYR family. Together, these results blur the boundaries between the fungal cell-wall families that were defined in C. albicans. TaqMan assays were used to quantify relative expression for each ALS gene. Some measurements were complicated by the assay location within the ALS gene. Considerable variation was noted in relative gene expression for isolates of the same species. Overall, however, there was a trend toward higher relative gene expression in saturated cultures rather than younger cultures. This work provides a complete description of the ALS genes in the C. parapsilosis species complex and a toolkit that promotes further investigations into the role of the Als proteins in host-fungal interactions.\n","515":"\nAccurate normalized data is a primary requisite for quantifying gene expression using RT-qPCR technology. Despite this importance, however, suitable reference genes in Osmanthus fragrans are not available. In this study, seven potential candidate reference genes (OfL25-1, OfL25-10, OfRP2, OfTUA, OfTUB3, OfUBQ2 and Of18S) were evaluated to determine which one would be the most reliable reference genes. The expression levels of the candidate reference genes were analysed by RT-qPCR in flower, leaf, pedicel, blossom bud tissues, as well as in floral organs at different developmental stages.GeNormand NormFinderwere used to statistically analyse transcript variation.Results indicated that OfRP2 and OfL25-10 were the optimal reference genes for use in RT-qPCR when analysing different stages of floral development; while OfTUB3 and OfL25-1 were optimal across tissues. The selected reference genes were used to examineOfMYB1 expression. The results appeared to be useful for future gene expression analyses aiming to characterize developmental stages and tissues of O. fragrans.\n","516":"\nWe reported changes in the co-regulated mRNA expression in iron walnut (Juglans sigillata) in response to soil pH treatments and identified mRNAs specific to acidic soil conditions. Phenotypic and physiological analyses revealed that iron walnut growth was greater for the pH 4-5 and pH 5-6 treatments than for the pH 3-4 and pH 6-7 treatments. A total of 2768 differentially expressed genes were detected and categorized into 12 clusters by Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). The 994 low-expression genes in cluster III and 255 high-expression genes in cluster X were classified as acid-responsive genes on the basis of the relationships between phenotype, physiology, and STEM clustering, and the two gene clusters were analyzed by a maximum likelihood (ML) evolutionary tree with the greatest log likelihood values. No prominent sub-clusters occurred in cluster III, but three occurred in cluster X. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that acid-responsive genes were related primarily to arginine biosynthesis and the arginine\/proline metabolism pathway, implying that polyamine accumulation may enhance iron walnut acid stress tolerance. Overall, our results revealed 1249 potentially acid-responsive genes in iron walnut, indicating that its response to acid stress involves different pathways and activated genes.\n","517":"\nQuantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) has been routinely used to quantify gene expression level. This technique determines the expression of a target gene by comparison to an internal control gene uniformly expressed among the samples analyzed. The reproducibility and reliability of the results depend heavily on the reference genes used. To achieve successful gene expression analyses for drought tolerance studies in rice, reference gene selection should be based on consistency in expression across variables. We aimed to provide reference genes that would be consistent across different tissues, developmental stages and genotypes of rice and hence improve the quality of data in qRT-PCR analysis.\nTen candidate reference genes were screened from four ubiquitously expressed gene families by analyzing public microarray data sets that included profiles of multiple organs, developmental stages, and water availability status in rice. These genes were evaluated through qRT-PCR experiments with a rigorous statistical analysis to determine the best reference genes. A ubiquitin isogene showed the best gene expression stability as a single reference gene, while a 3-gene combination of another ubiquitin and two cyclophilin isogenes was the best reference gene combination. Comparison between the qRT-PCR and in-house microarray data on roots demonstrated reliability of the identified reference genes to monitor the differential expression of drought-related candidate genes.\nSpecific isogenes from among the regularly used gene families were identified for use in qRT-PCR-based analyses for gene expression in studies on drought tolerance in rice. These were stable across variables of treatment, genotype, tissue and growth stage. A single gene and\/or a three gene set analysis is recommended, based on the resources available.\n","518":"\nBegonia semperflorens (B. semperflorens), belonging to the family Begoniaceae, has now been widely cultivated worldwide and is famous for its ornamental plants with colourful flowers and distinctive leaves. The selection of appropriate internal reference genes is very important to accurately determine target gene expression via quantitative real-time PCR. However, internal reference gene selection has never been conducted in B. semperflorens. In this study, seven candidate reference genes of B. semperflorens, including 18S ribosomal RNA (Bs18S), pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (BsPPR), actin-related protein 5 isoform X2 (BsACT), DNAJ homologue subfamily C member 17 (BsDNAJ), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (BsGAPDH), NAD-dependent malic enzyme 59\u00a0kDa isoform, mitochondria (BsNAD-ME), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase CYP26-2, chloroplast (BsCYP), which were obtained from our previous studies, were selected. The stabilities of these genes under stress conditions were analysed using geNorm and NormFinder. Validation of target gene expressions, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (BsPAL) and respiratory burst oxidase homologue D (BsRBOHD) under biotic and abiotic conditions, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (BsPAL), anthocyanidin synthase (BsANS), chalcone synthase (BsCHS), and flavanone-3-hydroxylase (BsF3H) under low temperature, using these seven internal reference genes for normalisation further confirmed the stabilities of the selected genes and indicated the need for reference gene selection for normalising gene expressions in B. semperflorens. Of the seven candidate reference genes, the combination of BsACT, BsDNAJ, and BsNAD-ME was the ideal reference gene set for normalising gene expression in samples under biotic conditions. BsCYP combined with BsACT or BsGAPDH was the best reference gene pair under abiotic conditions. BsACT and BsPPR could be combined to normalise gene expression under low temperature.

However, studies of gene coexpression analysis via jointing multiple microarray data of acute myocardial infarction still remain restricted.\nMicroarray data of acute myocardial infarction (GSE48060, GSE66360, GSE97320, and GSE19339) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Three data sets without heterogeneity (GSE48060, GSE66360, and GSE97320) were subjected to differential expression analysis using MetaDE package. Differentially expressed genes having upper 25% variation across samples were imported in weighted gene coexpression network analysis. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted for genes in the most significant module using DAVID. The predicted microRNAs to regulate target genes in the most significant module were identified using TargetScan.

It is a highly regulated process, and in order to address the regulatory aspect, the role of genes in the NAC transcription factor family during senescence of barley flag leaves was studied. Several members of the NAC transcription factor gene family were up-regulated during senescence in a microarray experiment, together with a large range of senescence-associated genes, reflecting the coordinated activation of degradation processes in senescing barley leaf tissues. This picture was confirmed in a detailed quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) experiment, which also showed distinct gene expression patterns for different members of the NAC gene family, suggesting a group of ~15 out of the 47 studied NAC genes to be important for signalling processes and for the execution of degradation processes during leaf senescence in barley. Seven models for DNA-binding motifs for NAC transcription factors were designed based on published motifs, and available promoter sequences of barley genes were screened for the motifs. Genes up-regulated during senescence showed a significant over-representation of the motifs, suggesting regulation by the NAC transcription factors. Furthermore, co-regulation studies showed that genes possessing the motifs in the promoter in general were highly co-expressed with members of the NAC gene family. In conclusion, a list of up to 15 NAC genes from barley that are strong candidates for being regulatory factors of importance for senescence and biotic stress-related traits affecting the productivity of cereal crop plants has been generated. Furthermore, a list of 71 senescence-associated genes that are potential target genes for these NAC transcription factors is presented. \n\u00a9 The Author 2014.

However, bean production in major producing regions is limited by biotic and abiotic stress, such as drought and salt stress. Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) genes play key roles in responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, only several bZIP genes involved in drought and salt stress in legumes, especially Vigna radiata and Vigna angularis, have been identified. In this study, we identified 54 and 50 bZIP proteins from whole-genome sequences of V. radiata and V. angularis, respectively. First, we comprehensively surveyed the characteristics of all bZIP genes, including their gene structure, chromosome distribution and motif composition. Phylogenetic trees showed that VrbZIP and VabZIP proteins were divided into ten clades comprising nine known and one unknown subgroup. The results of the nucleotide substitution rate of the orthologous gene pairs showed that bZIP proteins have undergone strong purifying selection: V. radiata and V. angularis diverged 1.25 million years ago (mya) to 9.20 mya (average of 4.95 mya). We also found that many cis-acting regulatory elements (CAREs) involved in abiotic stress and plant hormone responses were detected in the putative promoter regions of the bZIP genes. Finally, using the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method, we performed expression profiling of the bZIP genes in response to drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA). We identified several bZIP genes that may be involved in drought and salt responses. Generally, our results provided useful and rich resources of VrbZIP and VabZIP genes for the functional characterization and understanding of bZIP transcription factors (TFs) in warm-season legumes. In addition, our results revealed important and interesting data - a subset of VrbZIP and VabZIP gene expression profiles in response to drought, salt and ABA stress. These results provide gene expression evidence for the selection of candidate genes under drought and salt stress for future study.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, although various studies and advances have been conducted to understand the cellulolytic system and the transcriptional regulation of T. reesei, the whole set of genes related to lignocellulose degradation has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we inferred a weighted gene co-expression network analysis based on the transcriptome dataset of the T. reesei RUT-C30 strain aiming to identify new target genes involved in sugarcane bagasse breakdown. In total, ~70% of all the differentially expressed genes were found in 28 highly connected gene modules. Several cellulases, sugar transporters, and hypothetical proteins coding genes upregulated in bagasse were grouped into the same modules. Among them, a single module contained the most representative core of cellulolytic enzymes (cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, \u03b2-glucosidase, and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase). In addition, functional analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) revealed various classes of hydrolytic activity, cellulase activity, carbohydrate binding and cation:sugar symporter activity enriched in these modules. Several modules also showed GO enrichment for transcription factor activity, indicating the presence of transcriptional regulators along with the genes involved in cellulose breakdown and sugar transport as well as other genes encoding proteins with unknown functions. Highly connected genes (hubs) were also identified within each module, such as predicted transcription factors and genes encoding hypothetical proteins. In addition, various hubs contained at least one DNA binding site for the master activator Xyr1 according to our in silico analysis. The prediction of Xyr1 binding sites and the co-expression with genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes and sugar transporters suggest a putative role of these hubs in bagasse cell wall deconstruction. Our results demonstrate a vast range of new promising targets that merit additional studies to improve the cellulolytic potential of T. reesei strains and to decrease the production costs of 2G ethanol.\n","523":"\nThe superfamily Cobitoidea of the order Cypriniformes is a diverse group of fishes, inhabiting freshwater ecosystems across Eurasia and North Africa. The phylogenetic relationships of this well-corroborated natural group and diverse clade are critical to not only informing scientific communities of the phylogeny of the order Cypriniformes, the world's largest freshwater fish order, but are key to every area of comparative biology examining the evolution of traits, functional structures, and breeding behaviors to their biogeographic histories, speciation, anagenetic divergence, and divergence time estimates. In the present study, two mitochondrial gene sequences (COI, ND4+5) and four single-copy nuclear gene segments (RH1, RAG1, EGR2B, IRBP) were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships of the Cobitoidea as reconstructed from maximum likelihood (ML) and partitioned Bayesian Analysis (BA). Analyses of the combined mitochondrial\/nuclear gene datasets revealed five strongly supported monophyletic Cobitoidea families and their sister-group relationships: Botiidae+(Vaillantellidae+(Cobitidae+(Nemacheilidae+Balitoridae))). These recovered relationships are in agreement with previous systematic studies on the order Cypriniformes and\/or those focusing on the superfamily Cobitoidea. Using these relationships, our analyses revealed pattern lineage- or ecological-group-specific evolution of these genes for the Cobitoidea. These observations and results corroborate the hypothesis that these group-specific-ancestral ecological characters have contributed in the diversification and\/or adaptations within these groups. Positive selections were detected in RH1 of nemacheilids and in RAG1 of nemacheilids and genus Vaillantella, which indicated that evolution of RH1 (related to eye's optic sense) and RAG1 (related to immunity) genes appeared to be important for the diversification of these groups. The balitorid lineage (those species inhabiting fast-flowing riverine habitats) had, as compared with other cobitoid lineages, significantly different dN\/dS, dN and dS values for ND4 and IRBP genes. These significant differences are usually indicative of weaker selection pressure, and lineage-specific evolution on genes along the balitorid lineage. Furthermore, within Cobitoidea, excluding balitorids, species living in subtropics had significantly higher dN\/dS values in RAG1 and IRBP genes than those living in temperate and tropical zones. Among tropical cobitoids, genes COI, ND5, EGR2B, IRBP and RH1, had a significantly higher mean dS value than those species in subtropical and temperate groups. These findings suggest that the evolution of these genes could also be ecological-group-specific and may have played an important role in the adaptive evolution and diversification of these groups. Thus, we hypothesize that the genes included in the present study were actively involved in lineage- and\/or ecological-group-specific evolutionary processes of the highly diverse Cobitoidea. These two evolutionary patterns, both subject to further testing, are hypothesized as integral in the diversification with this major clade of the world's most diverse group of freshwater fishes.\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we utilized the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) method to integrate 10 eligible PCa microarray datasets from the GEO and identified a set of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor samples and normal, matched specimens. To explore potential associations between gene sets and PCa clinical features and to identify hub genes, we utilized WGCNA to construct gene co-expression networks incorporating the DEGs screened with the use of RRA. From the key module, we selected LMNB1, TK1, ZWINT, and RACGAP1 for validation. We found that these genes were up-regulated in PCa samples, and higher expression levels were associated with higher Gleason scores and tumor grades. Moreover, ROC and K-M plots indicated these genes had good diagnostic and prognostic value for PCa. On the other hand, methylation analyses suggested that the abnormal up-regulation of these four genes likely resulted from hypomethylation, while GSEA and GSVA for single hub gene revealed they all had a close association with proliferation of PCa cells. These findings provide new insight into PCa pathogenesis, and identify LMNB1, TK1, RACGAP1 and ZWINT as candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of PCa.\n","525":"\nIn this study, we aimed to find new genes associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) so that more comprehensive genes would be used for monitoring and\/or diagnosing patients. Illumina digital gene expression profiling was applied in two sample types - peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and synovial cells to compare the gene expression pattern between 17 patients with RA and three control groups (six osteoarthritis patients, three ankylosing spondylitis patients and 17 healthy controls). Bioinformatics was performed on pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction networks. Four novel genes from PBMCs - DHRS3, TTC38, SAP30BP and LPIN2 - were found to be associated with RA and further confirmed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Five new differentially expressed genes (EPYC, LIFR, GLDN, TADA3 and ZNRF3) found in synovial cells were not confirmed. Pathway analyses revealed 10 significantly enriched pathways, and a protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that four novel PBMC-derived genes were connected to previously reported genes by four intermediate genes. Therefore, we proposed that four newly identified PBMC-derived genes could be integrated with previously reported RA-associated genes to monitor and\/or diagnose RA.\n\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n","526":"\nGene expression analysis in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) fruit has drawn considerable attention with the availability of genome sequences to understand the regulatory mechanism of fruit development and to improve its quality. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is a routine technique for gene expression analysis. However, appropriate reference genes for transcript normalization in watermelon fruits have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of 12 genes for their potential use as reference genes in watermelon fruits. Expression variations of these genes were measured in 48 samples obtained from 12 successive developmental stages of parthenocarpic and fertilized fruits of two watermelon genotypes by using qRT-PCR analysis. Considering the effects of genotype, fruit setting method, and developmental stage, geNorm determined clathrin adaptor complex subunit (ClCAC), \u03b2-actin (ClACT), and alpha tubulin 5 (ClTUA5) as the multiple reference genes in watermelon fruit. Furthermore, ClCAC alone or together with SAND family protein (ClSAND) was ranked as the single or two best reference genes by NormFinder. By using the top-ranked reference genes to normalize the transcript abundance of phytoene synthase (ClPSY1), a good correlation between lycopene accumulation and ClPSY1 expression pattern was observed in ripening watermelon fruit. These validated reference genes will facilitate the accurate measurement of gene expression in the studies on watermelon fruit biology. \n","527":"\nDown syndrome is one of the most common chromosomal disorders and yet our understanding about the dysregulated genes in this disease is limited. Through this case study, we investigated the gene expression profile of primary amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AFMSCs) isolated from the amniotic sac of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 with one fetal hydrops at 17\u00a0weeks of gestation. AFMSCs were cultured to analyze the gene expression profiles for the human transcriptome array. Gene ontology was used to evaluate dysregulated gene functions. Total 25,799 genes were identified such that 65 were up-regulated (0.25%) and 111 were down-regulated (0.43%) with a log2 fold change trisomy 21\/euploidy (log2 [FC])\u00a0>\u00a01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). 16 genes were selected and verified by qRT-PCR, which showed compatible result with transcriptome array. At the chromosome level, chromosome 21 was found to carry the highest percentage of up-regulated genes (2.13%, 7\/329 genes) with the highest mean log2 [FC] (0.23, p\u00a0<\u00a010-5), particularly on 21q22.3. There were eight segments with significant mean log2 [FC] on chromosomes 1, 6, 11, and 21 for upregulation, and on chromosomes 16, 17, and 19 for downregulation, indicating a pattern of dysregulated genes clustering in domains along the genome. Gene ontology showed the identified genes associated with extracellular matrix organization (11 genes, p\u00a0=\u00a05.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-6) and central nervous system development (8 genes, p\u00a0=\u00a06.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-5). Using transcriptome analysis of the AFMSCs of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21, we report the dysregulated genes involved in Down syndrome, their predominance on chromosome 21, and the cluster pattern on the whole genome.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

While a few scab resistance genes (R genes) governing qualitative resistance have been isolated and characterized, the biological roles of genes governing quantitative resistance, supposed to be more durable, are still unknown. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the partial resistance of the old Belgian apple cultivar 'Pr\u00e9sident Roulin' against V. inaequalis.\nA global gene expression analysis was conducted in 'Pr\u00e9sident Roulin' (partially resistant) and in 'Gala' (susceptible) challenged by V. inaequalis by using the cDNA-AFLP method (cDNA-Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism). Transcriptome analysis revealed significant modulation (up- or down-regulation) of 281 out of approximately 20,500 transcript derived fragments (TDFs) in 'Pr\u00e9sident Roulin' 48 hours after inoculation. Sequence annotation revealed similarities to several genes encoding for proteins belonging to the NBS-LRR and LRR-RLK classes of plant R genes and to other defense-related proteins. Differentially expressed genes were sorted into functional categories according to their gene ontology annotation and this expression signature was compared to published apple cDNA libraries by Gene Enrichment Analysis. The first comparison was made with two cDNA libraries from Malus x domestica uninfected leaves, and revealed in both libraries a signature of enhanced expression in 'Pr\u00e9sident Roulin' of genes involved in response to stress and photosynthesis. In the second comparison, the pathogen-responsive TDFs from the partially resistant cultivar were compared to the cDNA library from inoculated leaves of Rvi6 (HcrVf2)-transformed 'Gala' lines (complete disease resistance) and revealed both common physiological events, and notably differences in the regulation of defense response, the regulation of hydrolase activity, and response to DNA damage. TDFs were in silico mapped on the 'Golden Delicious' apple reference genome and significant co-localizations with major scab R genes, but not with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for scab resistance nor resistance gene analogues (RGAs) were found.\nThis study highlights possible candidate genes that may play a role in the partial scab resistance mechanisms of 'Pr\u00e9sident Roulin' and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the partial resistance against apple scab.\n","529":"\nFemale moths synthesize species-specific sex pheromone components and release them to attract male moths, which depend on precise sex pheromone chemosensory system to locate females. Two types of genes involved in the sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation pathways play essential roles in this important moth behavior. To understand the function of genes in the sex pheromone pathway, this study investigated the genome-wide and digital gene expression of sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation genes in various adult tissues in the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, which is a notorious vegetable pest worldwide.\nA massive transcriptome data (at least 39.04 Gb) was generated by sequencing 6 adult tissues including male antennae, female antennae, heads, legs, abdomen and female pheromone glands from DBM by using Illumina 4000 next-generation sequencing and mapping to a published DBM genome. Bioinformatics analysis yielded a total of 89,332 unigenes among which 87 transcripts were putatively related to seven gene families in the sex pheromone biosynthesis pathway. Among these, seven [two desaturases (DES), three fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FAR) one acetyltransferase (ACT) and one alcohol dehydrogenase (AD)] were mainly expressed in the pheromone glands with likely function in the three essential sex pheromone biosynthesis steps: desaturation, reduction, and esterification. We also identified 210 odorant-degradation related genes (including sex pheromone-degradation related genes) from seven major enzyme groups. Among these genes, 100 genes are new identified and two aldehyde oxidases (AOXs), one aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), five carboxyl\/cholinesterases (CCEs), five UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), eight cytochrome P450 (CYP) and three glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) displayed more robust expression in the antennae, and thus are proposed to participate in the degradation of sex pheromone components and plant volatiles.\nTo date, this is the most comprehensive gene data set of sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation enzyme related genes in DBM created by genome- and transcriptome-wide identification, characterization and expression profiling. Our findings provide a basis to better understand the function of genes with tissue enriched expression. The results also provide information on the genes involved in sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation, and may be useful to identify potential gene targets for pest control strategies by disrupting the insect-insect communication using pheromone-based behavioral antagonists.\n","530":"\nWe have evaluated suitable reference genes for real time (RT)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis in Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia). We tested most frequently used genes in the literature such as \u03b2-Tubulin, Histone H3, Actin, Elongation factor-1\u03b1, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, together with newly added genes Annexin, SAND and TIP41. A total of 17 primer combinations for these eight genes were evaluated using cDNAs synthesized from 16 tissue samples from four groups, namely: flower bud, flower organ, fruit flesh and fruit skin. Gene expression stabilities were analyzed using geNorm and NormFinder software packages or by \u0394Ct method. geNorm analysis indicated three best performing genes as being sufficient for reliable normalization of RT-qPCR data. Suitable reference genes were different among sample groups, suggesting the importance of validation of gene expression stability of reference genes in the samples of interest. Ranking of stability was basically similar between geNorm and NormFinder, suggesting usefulness of these programs based on different algorithms. \u0394Ct method suggested somewhat different results in some groups such as flower organ or fruit skin; though the overall results were in good correlation with geNorm or NormFinder. Gene expression of two cold-inducible genes PpCBF2 and PpCBF4 were quantified using the three most and the three least stable reference genes suggested by geNorm. Although normalized quantities were different between them, the relative quantities within a group of samples were similar even when the least stable reference genes were used. Our data suggested that using the geometric mean value of three reference genes for normalization is quite a reliable approach to evaluating gene expression by RT-qPCR. We propose that the initial evaluation of gene expression stability by \u0394Ct method, and subsequent evaluation by geNorm or NormFinder for limited number of superior gene candidates will be a practical way of finding out reliable reference genes. \n","531":"\nAutophagy is the cell self-eating mechanism to maintain cell homeostasis by removing damaged intracellular proteins or organelles. It has also been implicated in the development and differentiation of various cell types including the adipocyte. Several links between adipogenic transcription factors and key autophagy genes has been suggested. In this study, we tried to model the gene expression and their transcriptional regulation during the adipocyte differentiation using high-throughput sequencing datasets of the 3T3-L1 cell model. We applied the gene expression and co-expression analysis to all and the subset of autophagy genes to study the binding, and occupancy patterns of adipogenic factors, co-factors and histone modifications on key autophagy genes. We also analyzed the gene expression of key autophagy genes under different transcription factor knockdown adipocyte cells. We found that a significant percent of the variance in the autophagy gene expression is explained by the differentiation stage of the cell. Adipogenic master regulators, such as CEBPB and PPARG target key autophagy genes directly. In addition, the same factor may also control autophagy gene expression indirectly through autophagy transcription factors such as FOXO1, TFEB or XBP1. Finally, the binding of adipogenic factors is associated with certain patterns of co-factors binding that might modulate the functions. Some of the findings were further confirmed under the knockdown of the adipogenic factors in the differentiating adipocytes. In conclusion, autophagy genes are regulated as part of the transcriptional programs through adipogenic factors either directly or indirectly through autophagy transcription factors during adipogenesis.\n","532":"\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of maternal exposure to di-( n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) on testicular development and function in pre-pubertal and post-pubertal male rat offspring. Fourteen pregnant female rats were equally divided into two groups: a control group and a DBP-treated group. During gestation day (GD) 12 to postnatal day (PND) 14, the control group was administered 1 ml\/day corn oil, and the DBP-treated group was administered DBP 500 mg\/kg\/day by oral gavage. On PND 25 (pre-puberty) and PND 60 (post-puberty), blood for serum and the testes were collected from five male offspring of each group. To determine the relationship between the methylation state of the c-Myc promoter and the expression of the c-Myc gene, some apoptotic-related genes, such as p53 and Bax, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene, and some growth arrest-related genes, such as BRD7 and GAS1, were examined. Compared with the control ( p < 0.05), at pre-puberty, DBP induces c-Myc hyper-methylation with significant downregulation for c-Myc, p53, Bax genes, and significant upregulation for Bcl-2, BRD7, and GAS1, while at post puberty, the methylation state and expression of c-Myc and apoptosis-related genes returned to control levels in the same sequence with the fold change in the expression of BRD7 and GAS1 genes. These findings suggest that DBP induced a transient pre-pubertal increase in c-Myc promoter methylation that may be associated with disruption of both apoptotic and growth mechanisms in the testes.\n","533":"\nIn our recent work, we found that pyrrolnitrin, and not phenazines, contributed to the suppression of the mycelia growth of Fusarium graminearum that causes heavy Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease in cereal crops. However, pyrrolnitrin production of Pseudomonas chlororaphis G05 in King's B medium was very low. Although a few regulatory genes mediating the prnABCD (the prn operon, pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic locus) expression have been identified, it is not enough for us to enhance pyrrolnitrin production by systematically constructing a genetically-engineered strain. To obtain new candidate genes involved in the regulation of the prn operon expression, we successfully constructed a fusion mutant G05\u0394phz\u0394prn::lacZ, in which most of the coding regions of the prn operon and the phzABCDEFG (the phz operon, phenazine biosynthetic locus) were deleted, and the promoter region plus the first thirty condons of the prnA was in-frame fused with the truncated lacZ gene on its chromosome. The expression of the fused lacZ reporter gene driven by the promoter of the prn operon made it easy for us to detect the level of the prn expression in terms of the color variation of colonies on LB agar plates supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal). With this fusion mutant as a recipient strain, mini-Tn5-based random insertional mutagenesis was then conducted. By picking up colonies with color change, it is possible for us to screen and identify new candidate genes involved in the regulation of the prn expression. Identification of additional regulatory genes in further work could reasonably be expected to increase pyrrolnitrin production in G05 and to improve its biological control function.\n","534":"\nAbscisic acid (ABA) is an endogenous phytohormone that plays important roles in the regulation of plant growth, development, and stress responses. The pyrabactin resistance 1-like (PYR\/PYL) protein is a core regulatory component of ABA signaling networks in plants. However, no details regarding this family in Brassica napus are available. Here, 46 PYLs were identified in the B. napus genome. Based on phylogenetic analysis, BnPYR1 and BnPYL1-3 belong to subfamily I, BnPYL7-10 belong to subfamily II, and BnPYL4-6 and BnPYL11-13 belong to subfamily III. Analysis of BnPYL conserved motifs showed that every subfamily contained four common motifs. By predicting cis-elements in the promoters, we found that all BnPYL members contained hormone- and stress-related elements and that expression levels of most BnPYLs were relatively higher in seeds at the germination stage than those in other organs or at other developmental stages. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment showed that BnPYL genes mainly participate in responses to stimuli. To identify crucial PYLs mediating the response to abiotic stress in B. napus, expression changes in 14 BnPYL genes were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR after drought, heat, and salinity treatments, and identified BnPYR1-3, BnPYL1-2, and BnPYL7-2 in respond to abiotic stresses. The findings of this study lay a foundation for further investigations of PYL genes in B. napus.\n","535":"\nTo grasp the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying epilepsy development (epileptogenesis) and epilepsy itself, it is important to understand the gene expression changes that occur during these phases. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a technique that rapidly and accurately determines gene expression changes. It is crucial, however, that stable reference genes are selected for each experimental condition to ensure that accurate values are obtained for genes of interest. If reference genes are unstably expressed, this can lead to inaccurate data and erroneous conclusions. To date, epilepsy studies have used mostly single, nonvalidated reference genes. This is the first study to systematically evaluate reference genes in male Sprague-Dawley rat models of epilepsy. We assessed 15 potential reference genes in hippocampal tissue obtained from 2 different models during epileptogenesis, 1 model during chronic epilepsy, and a model of noninjurious seizures. Reference gene ranking varied between models and also differed between epileptogenesis and chronic epilepsy time points. There was also some variance between the four mathematical models used to rank reference genes. Notably, we found novel reference genes to be more stably expressed than those most often used in experimental epilepsy studies. The consequence of these findings is that reference genes suitable for one epilepsy model may not be appropriate for others and that reference genes can change over time. It is, therefore, critically important to validate potential reference genes before using them as normalizing factors in expression analysis in order to ensure accurate, valid results.\n\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","536":"\nThe aim of this study was to identify potential key candidate genes and uncover their potential mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe gene expression profiles of GSE12021, GSE55457, GSE55584 and GSE55235 were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database, including 45 rheumatoid arthritis and 29 normal samples. The differentially expressed genes between the two types of samples were identified with the Linear Models for Microarray Analysis package using R language. The gene ontology functional and pathway enrichment analyses of differentially-expressed genes were performed using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery software followed by the construction of a protein-protein interaction network. In addition, hub gene identification and gene ontology functional and pathway enrichment analyses of the modules were performed.\nThe differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in immune response, inflammatory response, chemokine-mediated signaling pathway for rheumatoid arthritis patients. The top hub genes such as interleukin 6, jun proto-oncogene, chemokine receptor 5, epidermal growth factor receptor, were identified from the protein-protein interaction network. Sub-networks revealed hub genes were involved in significant pathways, including chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway. The seed node gene is toll-like receptor 7 and growth arrest and deoxyribonucleic-acid -damage-inducible beta in the model-1 and model-2 by module analysis, respectively.\nThese hub genes may be used as potential targets for rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis and treatment.\n","537":"\nThe natural rubber of Para rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, is the main crop involved in industrial rubber production due to its superior quality. The Hevea bark is commercially exploited to obtain latex, which is produced from the articulated secondary laticifer. The laticifer is well defined in the aspect of morphology; however, only some genes associated with its development have been reported. We successfully induced secondary laticifer in the jasmonic acid (JA)-treated and linolenic acid (LA)-treated Hevea bark but secondary laticifer is not observed in the ethephon (ET)-treated and untreated Hevea bark. In this study, we analysed 27,195 gene models using NimbleGen microarrays based on the Hevea draft genome. 491 filtered differentially expressed (FDE) transcripts that are common to both JA- and LA-treated bark samples but not ET-treated bark samples were identified. In the Eukaryotic Orthologous Group (KOG) analysis, 491 FDE transcripts belong to different functional categories that reflect the diverse processes and pathways involved in laticifer differentiation. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and KOG analysis, the profile of the FDE transcripts suggest that JA- and LA-treated bark samples have a sufficient molecular basis for secondary laticifer differentiation, especially regarding secondary metabolites metabolism. FDE genes in this category are from the cytochrome (CYP) P450 family, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, short-chain dehydrogenase\/reductase (SDR) family, or cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) family. The data includes many genes involved in cell division, cell wall synthesis, and cell differentiation. The most abundant transcript in FDE list was SDR65C, reflecting its importance in laticifer differentiation. Using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) as part of annotation and functional prediction, several characterised as well as uncharacterized transcription factors and genes were found in the dataset. Hence, the further characterization of these genes is necessary to unveil their role in laticifer differentiation. This study provides a platform for the further characterization and identification of the key genes involved in secondary laticifer differentiation. \nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of drought resistance in C. thesioides. To better understand drought resistance, we used transcriptome analysis and Illumina sequencing technology on C. thesioides, to identify drought-responsive genes. Using de novo assembly 55,268 unigenes were identified from 207.58 Gb of clean data. Amongst these, 36,265 were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved domains, gene ontology terms and metabolic pathways. The sequencing results showed that genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) under drought stress were enriched in pathways such as carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction. Moreover, many functional genes were up-regulated under severe drought stress to enhance tolerance. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed that there were key hub genes related to drought stress. Hundreds of candidate genes were identified under severe drought stress, including transcriptional factors such as MYB, G2-like, ERF, C2H2, NAC, NF-X1, GRF, HD-ZIP, HB-other, HSF, C3H, GRAS, WRKY, bHLH and Trihelix. These data are a valuable resource for further investigation into the molecular mechanism for drought stress in C. thesioides and will facilitate exploration of drought resistance genes.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The dataset of GSE36791 (accession number) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened for in the blood samples from patients with ruptured IAs and controls, followed by functional and pathway enrichment analyses. In addition, gene co-expression network was constructed and significant modules were extracted from the network by WGCNA R package. Screening for miRNAs that could regulate DEGs in the modules was performed and an analysis of regulatory relationships was conducted. RESULTS A total of 304 DEGs (167 up-regulated and 137 down-regulated genes) were screened for in blood samples from patients with ruptured IAs compared with those from controls. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were mainly associated with immune response and the down-regulated DEGs were mainly concerned with the structure of ribosome and translation. Besides, six functional modules were significantly identified, including four modules enriched by up-regulated genes and two modules enriched by down-regulated genes. Thereinto, the blue, yellow, and turquoise modules of up-regulated genes were all linked with immune response. Additionally, 16 miRNAs were predicted to regulate DEGs in the three modules associated with immune response, such as hsa-miR-1304, hsa-miR-33b, hsa-miR-125b, and hsa-miR-125a-5p.

Non-dominant HS cases are due to de novo mutations of the type associated with dominant inheritance or recessive genes. This study is aimed to identify HS-related biological mechanisms and predicting HS candidate genes.\nWe searched the known HS-related genes from the public databases. By analyzing the gene ontology (GO) and biological pathway of these genes, we extracted the optimal features to encode HS genes. Based on them, we predicted the HS-related genes from genes of whole genomes using the Random Forest classification. We used the gene interaction networks analysis to further identify the core regulatory genes that were related to HS.\nForty-one known HS-related genes were found out and encoded. Three hundred and sixty-seven GO terms and ten biological pathway terms were identified as the optimal features for prediction. We subsequently predicted 150 novel HS-related genes and identified the core regulatory genes in the interaction network of predicted and known genes.

However, genetic screens of plant mutants typically yield very low frequencies of desired phenotypes. Here, we present a powerful computational approach for selecting candidate genes for screening insertion mutants. We combined ranking of Arabidopsis thaliana regulatory genes according to their expression in response to multiple abiotic stresses (Multiple Stress [MST] score), with stress-responsive RNA co-expression network analysis to select candidate multiple stress regulatory (MSTR) genes. Screening of 62 T-DNA insertion mutants defective in candidate MSTR genes, for abiotic stress germination phenotypes yielded a remarkable hit rate of up to 62%; this gene discovery rate is 48-fold greater than that of other large-scale insertional mutant screens. Moreover, the MST score of these genes could be used to prioritize them for screening. To evaluate the contribution of the co-expression analysis, we screened 64 additional mutant lines of MST-scored genes that did not appear in the RNA co-expression network. The screening of these MST-scored genes yielded a gene discovery rate of 36%, which is much higher than that of classic mutant screens but not as high as when picking candidate genes from the co-expression network. The MSTR co-expression network that we created, AraSTressRegNet is publicly available at http:\/\/netbio.bgu.ac.il\/arnet. This systems biology-based screening approach combining gene ranking and network analysis could be generally applicable to enhancing identification of genes regulating additional processes in plants and other organisms provided that suitable transcriptome data are available. \n\u00a9 2014 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n","543":"\nFructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase (FBA) is a key enzyme in plants, which is involved not only in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the cytoplasm, but also in the Calvin cycle in plastids. Research on FBAs in various organisms has been reported, but there is none on FBAs in Arabidopsis at the molecular level. In the current study, eight FBA family genes (AtFBA1-8) were identified and analyzed in Arabidopsis thaliana. These genes have a highly conserved aldolase-type TIM barrel domain and a C-terminal peptide, but variable N-terminal peptides. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of FBA protein sequences from Arabidopsis and other plant species, AtFBA family was classified into two subfamilies, including three members (AtFBA1-3) with high similarities to FBAs occurring at plastid, and five (AtFBA4-8) with high similarities to FBAs localized in the cytoplasm. By confocal microscopy analysis with GFP fusion protein, AtFBA3 and AtFBA4 as well as AtFBA6 were observed to be localized in the plastid and cytoplasm, respectively. At least two duplicated gene pairs of AtFBA1 and AtFBA2, as well as AtFBA4 and AtFBA8 were found. Transcript level analysis of AtFBA genes in various tissues revealed the unique and overlapping expression patterns of plastid and cytosol AtFBA genes, suggesting that these genes may function at different stages of plant growth and development. Interestingly, AtFBA1, AtFBA2, AtFBA5 and AtFBA7 showed undetectable expression in roots. The expression patterns of AtFBA genes under different stress conditions suggested that all the members showed different expression patterns in response to stresses, including ABA, NaCl, Cd, abnormal temperature and drought, and, except for AtFBA3, most of the AtFBA genes were significantly responsive to drought stress in roots. Moreover, AtFBA1, AtFBA2, AtFBA5, AtFBA7 and AtFBA8 were induced by at least one of three sugars (sucrose, glucose and fructose) after 24h of treatment. Further functional analyses indicated important clues of AtFBA2, AtFBA6 and AtFBA8 in plant growth, stress responses and development, respectively. Thus these results provide additional knowledge on AtFBA families and their roles.\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The identification of suitable reference genes that are not affected by the experimental conditions is a critical step in accurate normalization of the reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), a commonly used assay to elucidate changes in the gene expression profile. In the present study, the effects of the cafeteria diet and sympathetic innervation on the gene expression of adrenoceptor beta 3 (Adrb3) from BAT and WAT were assessed using one of the most stable and one of the least stable genes as normalizers. Rats were fed the cafeteria diet and on the 17th day, interscapular BAT or retroperitoneal WAT was denervated and, 7 days after surgery, the contralateral innervated tissue was used as control.

According to the algorithms employed, the normalization of Adrb3 expression by the least stable genes produced opposite results compared with the most stable genes and literature data. In cafeteria and control diet-fed rats, the three most stable genes were Hprt1, Tbp, and Rpl32 for interscapular BAT and Tbp, B2m, and Hprt1 for retroperitoneal WAT, while the least stable genes were 18S, Actb, and Gapdh for both tissues.\n\u00a9 2019 AOCS.\n","545":"\nSensing, responding, and adapting to the surrounding environment are crucial for all living organisms to survive, proliferate, and differentiate in their biological niches. Beauveria bassiana is an economically important insect-pathogenic fungus which is widely used as a biocontrol agent to control a variety of insect pests. The fungal pathogen unavoidably encounters a variety of adverse environmental stresses and defense response from the host insects during application of the fungal agents. However, few are known about the transcription response of the fungus to respond or adapt varied adverse stresses. Here, we comparatively analyzed the transcriptome of B. bassiana in globe genome under the varied stationary-phase stresses including osmotic agent (0.8\u202fM NaCl), high temperature (32\u202f\u00b0C), cell wall-perturbing agent (Congo red), and oxidative agents (H2O2 or menadione). Total of 12,412 reads were obtained, and mapped to the 6767 genes of the B. bassiana. All of these stresses caused transcription responses involved in basal metabolism, cell wall construction, stress response or cell rescue\/detoxification, signaling transduction and gene transcription regulation, and likely other cellular processes. An array of genes displayed similar transcription patterns in response to at least two of the five stresses, suggesting a shared transcription response to varied adverse stresses. Gene co-expression network analysis revealed that mTOR signaling pathway, but not HOG1 MAP kinase pathway, played a central role in regulation the varied adverse stress responses, which was verified by RNAi-mediated knockdown of TOR1.

The results showed that only 32 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the two morphs, of which 18 had functional annotations. Among them, 13 genes were up-regulated [e.g. genes encoding protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (LOC100570971), carotene dehydrogenase (tor) and V-type proton ATPase subunit B (LOC100169462)] and 5 genes were down-regulated in the red morph (e.g. genes encoding transcription factors and heat shock proteins). To assess the functional importance of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we selected three highly expressed DEGs (LOC100169462, LOC100570971 and tor) with functional annotations and analyzed their expression levels in the red morph under three low temperatures (1\u202f\u00b0C, 4\u202f\u00b0C, and 8\u202f\u00b0C) for 24\u202fh. These three DEGs showed an interesting expression response to the cold acclimating conditions which resulted in an obvious phenotypic change of the red individuals to be greenish variants.

Thus, altered expression levels of several autophagy related genes may affect protein levels, which in turn would influence the activity of autophagy, or most probably, those genes might be acting independent of autophagy and contributing to MS pathogenesis as risk factors.

To examine the application of the model to other taxa, I studied the expression and function of pair-rule genes in Bombyx mori, together with a Bombyx homolog of Kr\u00fcppel (Bm-Kr), a known gap gene. Knockdown embryos of Bombyx homologs of eve, run and odd (Bm-eve, Bm-run and Bm-odd) exhibited asegmental phenotypes similar to those of Tribolium knockdowns. However, pair-rule gene interactions were similar to those of both Tribolium and Drosophila, which, different from Tribolium, shows a hierarchical segmentation mode. Additionally, the Bm-odd expression pattern shares characteristics with those of Drosophila pair-rule genes that receive upstream regulatory input. On the other hand, Bm-Kr knockdowns exhibited a large posterior segment deletion as observed in short-germ insects. However, a detailed analysis of these embryos indicated that Bm-Kr modulates expression of pair-rule genes like in Drosophila, although the mechanisms appear to be different. This suggested hierarchical interactions between Bm-Kr and pair-rule genes.

In the current study, we mined the genome-wide expression profiling and investigated the novel biological pathways associated with SSD.Methods: Expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analysed with microarrays of blood tissue cohort of eight SSD patients and eight healthy subjects. The gene co-expression is calculated by WGCNA, an R package software. The function of the genes was annotated by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.Results: We identified 11 modules from the 9,427 DEGs. Three co-expression modules (blue, cyan and red) showed striking correlation with the phenotypic trait between SSD and healthy controls. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that the function of these three modules was enriched with the pathway of inflammatory response and type II diabetes mellitus. Finally, three hub genes, NT5DC1, SGSM2 and MYCBP, were identified from the blue module as significant genes.Conclusions: This first blood gene expression study in SSD observed distinct patterns between cases and controls which may provide novel insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms of SSD.\n","550":"\nPullulan produced by Aureobasidium pullulans presents various applications in food manufacturing and pharmaceutical industry. However, the pullulan biosynthesis mechanism remains unclear. This work proposed a pathway suggesting that heavy oil and melanin may correlate with pullulan production. The effects of overexpression or deletion of genes encoding apolipoprotein, UDPG-pyrophosphorylase, glucosyltransferase, and \u03b1-phosphoglucose mutase on the production of pullulan, heavy oil, and melanin were examined. Pullulan production increased by 16.93 and 8.52% with the overexpression of UDPG-pyrophosphorylase and apolipoprotein genes, respectively. Nevertheless, the overexpression or deletion of other genes exerted little effect on pullulan biosynthesis. Heavy oil production increased by 146.30, 64.81, and 33.33% with the overexpression of UDPG-pyrophosphorylase, \u03b1-phosphoglucose mutase, and apolipoprotein genes, respectively. Furthermore, the syntheses of pullulan, heavy oil, and melanin can compete with one another. This work may provide new guidance to improve the production of pullulan, heavy oil, and melanin through genetic approach.\n","551":"\nDifferential gene expression (DGE) analysis is commonly used to reveal the deregulated molecular mechanisms of complex diseases. However, traditional DGE analysis (e.g., the t test or the rank sum test) tests each gene independently without considering interactions between them. Top-ranked differentially regulated genes prioritized by the analysis may not directly relate to the coherent molecular changes underlying complex diseases. Joint analyses of co-expression and DGE have been applied to reveal the deregulated molecular modules underlying complex diseases. Most of these methods consist of separate steps: first to identify gene-gene relationships under the studied phenotype then to integrate them with gene expression changes for prioritizing signature genes, or vice versa. It is warrant a method that can simultaneously consider gene-gene co-expression strength and corresponding expression level changes so that both types of information can be leveraged optimally.\nIn this paper, we develop a gene module based method for differential gene expression analysis, named network-based differential gene expression (nDGE) analysis, a one-step integrative process for prioritizing deregulated genes and grouping them into gene modules. We demonstrate that nDGE outperforms existing methods in prioritizing deregulated genes and discovering deregulated gene modules using simulated data sets. When tested on a series of smoker and non-smoker lung adenocarcinoma data sets, we show that top differentially regulated genes identified by the rank sum test in different sets are not consistent while top ranked genes defined by nDGE in different data sets significantly overlap. nDGE results suggest that a differentially regulated gene module, which is enriched for cell cycle related genes and E2F1 targeted genes, plays a role in the molecular differences between smoker and non-smoker lung adenocarcinoma.\nIn this paper, we develop nDGE to prioritize deregulated genes and group them into gene modules by simultaneously considering gene expression level changes and gene-gene co-regulations. When applied to both simulated and empirical data, nDGE outperforms the traditional DGE method. More specifically, when applied to smoker and non-smoker lung cancer sets, nDGE results illustrate the molecular differences between smoker and non-smoker lung cancer.\n","552":"\nNematodes have evolved the ability to parasitize plants on at least four independent occasions, with plant parasites present in Clades 1, 2, 10 and 12 of the phylum. In the case of Clades 10 and 12, horizontal gene transfer of plant cell wall degrading enzymes from bacteria and fungi has been implicated in the evolution of plant parasitism. We have used ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) to generate reference transcriptomes for two economically important nematode species, Xiphinema index and Longidorus elongatus, representative of two genera within the early-branching Clade 2 of the phylum Nematoda. We used a transcriptome-wide analysis to identify putative horizontal gene transfer events. This represents the first in-depth transcriptome analysis from any plant-parasitic nematode of this clade. For each species, we assembled ~30 million Illumina reads into a reference transcriptome. We identified 62 and 104 transcripts, from X. index and L. elongatus, respectively, that were putatively acquired via horizontal gene transfer. By cross-referencing horizontal gene transfer prediction with a phylum-wide analysis of Pfam domains, we identified Clade 2-specific events. Of these, a GH12 cellulase from X. index was analysed phylogenetically and biochemically, revealing a likely bacterial origin and canonical enzymatic function. Horizontal gene transfer was previously shown to be a phenomenon that has contributed to the evolution of plant parasitism among nematodes. Our findings underline the importance and the extensiveness of this phenomenon in the evolution of plant-parasitic life styles in this speciose and widespread animal phylum.\n","553":"\nCanalizing genes enforce broad corrective actions on cellular processes for the purpose of biological robustness maintaining a constant phenotype to remain unchanged in spite of genetic mutations or environmental perturbations. Despite their central role in biological systems, the observation\/detection of canalizing genes is often impeded because the behavior of affected genes is highly varied relative to the inactive canalizer. Therefore, the activity of canalizing genes is difficult to predict to any significant degree by their subject genes under normal cell conditions.\nWe investigate this question and present a quantitative framework that allows for the estimation of the power of canalizing genes in the context of Boolean Networks (BNs) with perturbation. This framework borrows tools from the Pattern Recognition theory and uses the coefficient of determination (CoD) to capture the capacity of the canalizing genes. The canalizing power (CP) of a gene is quantitatively characterized by two terms: regulation power (RP) and incapacitating power (IP). We base this assumption on the idea that canalizing power of a gene should be quantified by the extent of its regulation on the overall network and the extent of control that the gene takes over from other master genes when it is activated, which is equivalent to reduction of the control of other master genes upon its activation. Following this, the CP concept is illustrated with examples in which the goal is to provide preliminary evidence that CP can be used to characterize the ability of canalizing genes.\nA library of functions written in MATLAB for computing CP is available at http:\/\/github.com\/eunjikim-angie\/CanalizingPower.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

We hypothesized that Arachis species evolved genes specifically involved in the control of aerial flowers and the formation of underground fruits. Arachis duranensis is more resistant to biotic and abiotic stressors. Here, we compared different legume species and identified Arachis duranensis-specific genes. We analyzed gene expression patterns, base substitution patterns and sequence features between genes that are conserved across legume plants and A. duranensis-specific genes. Furthermore, we tested the role of A. duranensis-specific genes during seed development, response to nematode Meloidogyne arenaria infection and drought stress. We found that A. duranensis-specific genes had characteristics of young genes. The gene expression level and breadth were lower in the A. duranensis-specific genes compared to conserved genes. The A. duranensis-specific genes had higher codon usage bias than conserved genes, and the polypeptide length and GC content at the three codon sites were lower compared to conserved genes. Of the A. duranensis-specific genes, single-copy and duplicated genes had different features. The RNA-seq result showed A. duranensis-specific genes were involved in seed development, as well as response to nematode infection and drought stress. In addition, we detected asymmetric functions in A. duranensis-specific duplicated genes in response to nematode infection and drought stress.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There are at least two difficulties, isolation of the genuine susceptibility genes from many indirectly associated genes and functional validation of these genes.\nWe first proposed a novel conditional gene-based association test which can use only summary statistics to isolate independently associated genes of a disease. Applying this method, we detected 185 genes of independent association with schizophrenia. We then designed an in-silico experiment based on expression\/co-expression to systematically validate pathogenic potential of these genes. We found that genes of independent association with schizophrenia formed more co-expression pairs in normal post-natal but not pre-natal human brain regions than expected. Interestingly, no co-expression enrichment was found in the brain regions of schizophrenia patients. The genes with independent association also had more significant P-values for differential expression between schizophrenia patients and controls in the brain regions. In contrast, indirectly associated genes or associated genes by other widely-used gene-based tests had no such differential expression and co-expression patterns. In summary, this conditional gene-based association test is effective for isolating directly associated genes from indirectly associated genes, and the results insightfully suggest that common variants might contribute to schizophrenia largely by distorting expression and co-expression in post-natal brains.\nThe conditional gene-based association test has been implemented in a platform 'KGG' in Java and is publicly available at http:\/\/grass.cgs.hku.hk\/limx\/kgg\/.\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

Although the HD-Zip gene family, especially the HD-Zip I subfamily, has been extensively studied in many plant species, the systematic report on HD-Zip I subfamily in cultivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is lacking. In this study, 39 HD-Zip I genes were systematically identified in N. tabacum (Nt). Interestingly, that 64.5% of the 31 genes with definite chromosome location information were found to originate from N. tomentosoformis, one of the two ancestral species of allotetraploid N. tabacum. Phylogenetic analysis divided the NtHD-Zip I subfamily into eight clades. Analysis of gene structures showed that NtHD-Zip I proteins contained conserved homeodomain and leucine-zipper domains. Three-dimensional structure analysis revealed that most NtHD-Zip I proteins in each clade, except for those in clade \u03b7, share a similar structure to their counterparts in Arabidopsis. Prediction of cis-regulatory elements showed that a number of elements responding to abscisic acid and different abiotic stresses, including low temperature, drought, and salinity, existed in the promoter region of NtHD-Zip I genes. The prediction of Arabidopsis ortholog-based protein-protein interaction network implied that NtHD-Zip I proteins have complex connections. The expression profile of these genes showed that different NtHD-Zip I genes were highly expressed in different tissues and could respond to abscisic acid and low-temperature treatments. Our study provides insights into the evolution and expression patterns of NtHD-Zip I genes in N. tabacum and will be useful for further functional characterization of NtHD-Zip I genes in the future.\n","557":"\nThe solute carrier 6 (SLC6) gene family, functioning as neurotransmitter transporters, plays the crucial roles in neurotransmission, cellular and organismal homeostasis. In this study, we found an expansion of SLC6 family gene in the genome of chordate invertebrate Ciona savignyi. A total of 40 candidate genes including 29 complete and 11 putative genes were identified as SLC6 family gene homologs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of these Ciona SLC6 genes were highly conserved with the vertebrate ones, although gene duplication and gene losses did exist. Four genes were selected from SLC6 subfamilies to be further investigated for their functional characteristics on cell growth and migration through overexpression approach in cultured cell lines. The results showed both SLC6A7 and SLC6A17 from amino acid transporters AA1 and AA2 sub-families, respectively, significantly suppressed the cell proliferation and migration. While SLC6A1 and SLC6A4, which were classified into GABA and monoamine transporters, respectively, did not affect the cell proliferation and migration in HEK293T, HeLa, and MCF7 cells. The whole set of C. savignyi SLC6 genes identified in this study provides an important genomic resource for future biochemical, physiological, and phylogenetic studies on SLC6 gene family. Our experimental data demonstrated that Ciona amino acid transporters, such as SLC6A7 and SLC6A17, were essential for cell physiology and behaviors, indicating their crucially potential roles in the control of cell proliferation and migration during ascidian embryogenesis.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This presents a major challenge in the clinical setting, where the recent application of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing has uncovered thousands of genetic variants of uncertain significance. Here, we present a strategy for targeted human gene replacement and phenomic characterization, based on CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering in the genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, that will facilitate assessment of the functional conservation of human genes and structure-function analysis of disease-associated variants with unprecedented precision. We validate our strategy by demonstrating that direct single-copy replacement of the C. elegans ortholog (daf-18) with the critical human disease-associated gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is sufficient to rescue multiple phenotypic abnormalities caused by complete deletion of daf-18, including complex chemosensory and mechanosensory impairments. In addition, we used our strategy to generate animals harboring a single copy of the known pathogenic lipid phosphatase inactive PTEN variant (PTEN-G129E), and showed that our automated in vivo phenotypic assays could accurately and efficiently classify this missense variant as loss of function. The integrated nature of the human transgenes allows for analysis of both homozygous and heterozygous variants and greatly facilitates high-throughput precision medicine drug screens. By combining genome engineering with rapid and automated phenotypic characterization, our strategy streamlines the identification of novel conserved gene functions in complex sensory and learning phenotypes that can be used as in vivo functional assays to decipher variants of uncertain significance.\n\u00a9 2018.

Due to its unique composition, in recent years an increasing interest in mare's milk consumption has been observed. Thus, investigating the genetic background of horse's milk variability presents and interesting study model. Relying on 39 milk samples collected from mares representing three breeds (Polish Primitive Horse, Polish Cold-blooded Horse, Polish Warmblood Horse) we aimed to investigate the utility of equine milk somatic cells as a source of mRNA and to screen the best reference genes for RT-qPCR using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The results showed that despite relatively low somatic cell counts in mare's milk, the amount and the quality of the extracted RNA are sufficient for gene expression studies. The analysis of the utility of 7 potential reference genes for RT-qPCR experiments for the normalization of equine milk somatic cells revealed some differences between the outcomes of the applied algorithms, although in both cases the KRT8 and TOP2B genes were pointed as the most stable. Analysis by geNorm showed that the combination of 4 reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, TOP2B and KRT8) is required for apropriate RT-qPCR experiments normalization, whereas NormFinder algorithm pointed the combination of KRT8 and RPS9 genes as the most suitable. The trial study of the relative transcript abundance of the beta-casein gene with the use of various types and numbers of internal control genes confirmed once again that the selection of proper reference gene combinations is crucial for the final results of each real-time PCR experiment. \n","560":"\nThe aim of the present study was to identify the target genes of cediranib and the associated signaling pathways in alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). A microarray dataset (GSE32569) was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The R software package was used for data normalization and screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used to perform Gene Ontology analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to obtain the up- and downregulated pathways in ASPS. The Distant Regulatory Elements of co-regulated genes database was used to identify the transcription factors (TFs) that were enriched in the signaling pathways. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes\/Proteins database and was visualized using Cytoscape software. A total of 71 DEGs, including 59 upregulated genes and 12 downregulated genes, were identified. Gene sets associated with ASPS were enriched primarily in four signaling pathways: The phenylalanine metabolism pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, the taste transduction pathway and the intestinal immune network for the production of immunoglobulin A. Furthermore, 107 TFs were identified to be enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. Certain genes, including those coding for Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, kinase insert domain receptor, E-selectin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor D, that were associated with other genes in the PPI network, were identified. The present study identified certain potential target genes and the associated signaling pathways of cediranib action in ASPS, which may be helpful in understanding the efficacy of cediranib and the development of new targets for cediranib.\n","561":"\nNAC proteins are one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors (TFs). They regulate diverse complex biological processes, including secondary xylem differentiation and wood formation. Recent genomic and transcriptomic studies of Tectona grandis L.f.

In the present work, T. grandis NAC genes were identified and analyzed regarding to their evolution and expression profile during wood formation. We analyzed the recently published T. grandis genome, and identified 130 NAC proteins that are coded by 107 gene loci. These proteins were classified into 23 clades of the NAC family, together with Populus, Eucalyptus, and Arabidopsis. Data on transcript expression revealed specific temporal and spatial expression patterns for the majority of teak NAC genes. RT-PCR indicated expression of VND genes (Tg11g04450-VND2 and Tg15g08390-VND4) related to secondary cell wall formation in xylem vessels of 16-year-old juvenile trees.

Many gene expression profiling studies have been conducted to investigate the responses of soybean to the infection by this pathogen using primarily the first-generation soybean genome array that covered approximately 37,500 soybean transcripts. However, no study has been reported yet using the second-generation Affymetrix soybean whole-genome transcript array (Soybean WT array) that represents approximately 66,000 predicted soybean transcripts.\nIn the present work, the gene expression profiles of two soybean plant introductions (PIs) PI 437654 and PI 567516C (both resistant to multiple SCN HG Types) and cultivar Magellan (susceptible to SCN) were compared in the presence or absence of the SCN inoculum at 3 and 8\u00a0days post-inoculation using the Soybean WT array. Data analysis revealed that the two resistant soybean lines showed distinctive gene expression profiles from each other and from Magellan not only in response to the SCN inoculation, but also in the absence of SCN. Overall, 1,413 genes and many pathways were revealed to be differentially regulated. Among them, 297 genes were constitutively regulated in the two resistant lines (compared with Magellan) and 1,146 genes were responsive to the SCN inoculation in the three lines, with 30 genes regulated both constitutively and by SCN. In addition to the findings similar to those in the published work, many genes involved in ethylene, protein degradation, and phenylpropanoid pathways were also revealed differentially regulated in the present study. GC-rich elements (e.g., GCATGC) were found over-represented in the promoter regions of certain groups of genes. These have not been observed before, and could be new defense-responsive regulatory elements.\nDifferent soybean lines showed different gene expression profiles in the presence and absence of the SCN inoculum. Both inducible and constitutive gene expression may contribute to resistance to multiple SCN HG Types in the resistant soybean PI lines. Ethylene, protein degradation, and phenylpropanoid pathways, as well as many other pathways reported previously, may play important roles in mediating the soybean-SCN interactions. The revealed genes, pathways, and promoter elements can be further explored to regulate or engineer soybean for resistance to SCN.\n","563":"\nProtein complexes that bind to 'GAGA' DNA elements are necessary to replace nucleosomes to create a local chromatin environment that facilitates a variety of site-specific regulatory responses. Three to four elements are required for the disruption of a preassembled nucleosome.

The functional implication of those GA-repeats is beginning to emerge in the core promoter of the human SOX5 gene, which is involved in multiple developmental processes. In the current study, we analyze the functional implication of GA-repeats in the core promoter of two additional genes, MECOM and GABRA3, whose expression is largely limited to embryogenesis. We report a significant difference in gene expression as a result of different alleles across those core promoters in the HEK-293 cell line. Across-species homology check for the GABRA3 GA-repeats revealed that those repeats are evolutionary conserved in mouse and primates (p<1 \u00d7 10(-8)). The MECOM core promoter GA-repeats are also conserved in numerous species, of which human has the longest repeat and complexity. We propose a novel role for GA-repeat core promoters to regulate gene expression in the genes involved in development and evolution.\n\u00a9 2013.\n","564":"\nDiagnostic DNA markers are an invaluable resource in breeding programs for successful introgression and pyramiding of disease resistance genes. Resistance to downy mildew (DM) disease in sunflower is mediated by Pl genes which are known to be effective against the causal fungus, Plasmopara halstedii. Two DM resistance genes, Pl Arg and Pl 8 , are highly effective against P. halstedii races in the USA, and have been previously mapped to the sunflower linkage groups (LGs) 1 and 13, respectively, using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. In this study, we developed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps encompassing the Pl arg and Pl 8 genes and identified diagnostic SNP markers closely linked to these genes. The specificity of the diagnostic markers was validated in a highly diverse panel of 548 sunflower lines. Dissection of a large marker cluster co-segregated with Pl Arg revealed that the closest SNP markers NSA_007595 and NSA_001835 delimited Pl Arg to an interval of 2.83\u00a0Mb on the LG1 physical map. The SNP markers SFW01497 and SFW06597 delimited Pl 8 to an interval of 2.85\u00a0Mb on the LG13 physical map. We also developed sunflower lines with homozygous, three gene pyramids carrying Pl Arg , Pl 8 , and the sunflower rust resistance gene R 12 using the linked SNP markers from a segregating F2 population of RHA 340 (carrying Pl 8 )\/RHA 464 (carrying Pl Arg and R 12 ).

For effective qPCR analyses, suitable reference genes are needed for normalization. The objective of this study is to identify the appropriate reference gene(s) for qPCR analyses of the leaves and roots of ramie (Boehmeria nivea L.), an important natural fiber crop. To accomplish this goal, we investigated the expression patterns of eight common plant qPCR reference genes in ramie leaves and roots under five abiotic stresses, five hormonal treatments, and one biotic stress. The relative expression stabilities of the eight genes were evaluated using four common but different approaches: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Across the 11 tested conditions, ACT1 was the most stably expressed among the eight genes while GAPDH displayed the biggest variation. Overall, while variations in the suggested reference genes were found for different tissue x treatment combinations, our analyses revealed that together, genes ACT1, CYP2, and UBQ can provide robust references for gene expression studies of ramie leaves under most conditions, while genes EF-1\u03b1, TUB, and ACT1 can be used for similar studies of ramie roots.

Traditional methods using Sanger sequencing focus on small groups of genes and therefore are unable to screen for numerous genes from several patients simultaneously. The goal of the present study was to validate a 25-gene panel to assess genetic risk for cancer in 8 different tissues using next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques.\nTwenty-five genes associated with hereditary cancer syndromes were selected for development of a panel to screen for risk of these cancers using NGS. In an initial technical assessment, NGS results for BRCA1 and BRCA2 were compared with Sanger sequencing in 1864 anonymized DNA samples from patients who had undergone previous clinical testing. Next, the entire gene panel was validated using parallel NGS and Sanger sequencing in 100 anonymized DNA samples. Large rearrangement analysis was validated using NGS, microarray comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analyses (MLPA).\nNGS identified 15,877 sequence variants, while Sanger sequencing identified 15,878 in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 comparison study of the same regions. Based on these results, the NGS process was refined prior to the validation of the full gene panel. In the validation study, NGS and Sanger sequencing were 100% concordant for the 3,923 collective variants across all genes for an analytical sensitivity of the NGS assay of >99.92% (lower limit of 95% confidence interval). NGS, microarray CGH and MLPA correctly identified all expected positive and negative large rearrangement results for the 25-gene panel.\nThis study provides a thorough validation of the 25-gene NGS panel and indicates that this analysis tool can be used to collect clinically significant information related to risk of developing hereditary cancers.\n","567":"\nThe shoot apical meristem (SAM) orchestrates the balance between stem cell proliferation and organ initiation essential for postembryonic shoot growth. Meristems show a striking diversity in shape and size. How this morphological diversity relates to variation in plant architecture and the molecular circuitries driving it are unclear. By generating a high-resolution gene expression atlas of the vegetative maize shoot apex, we show here that distinct sets of genes govern the regulation and identity of stem cells in maize versus Arabidopsis. Cell identities in the maize SAM reflect the combinatorial activity of transcription factors (TFs) that drive the preferential, differential expression of individual members within gene families functioning in a plethora of cellular processes. Subfunctionalization thus emerges as a fundamental feature underlying cell identity. Moreover, we show that adult plant characters are, to a significant degree, regulated by gene circuitries acting in the SAM, with natural variation modulating agronomically important architectural traits enriched specifically near dynamically expressed SAM genes and the TFs that regulate them.

However, most reported work does not follow the minimum information for publication of qPCR experiments (MIQE) recommendation that multiple, stably expressed reference genes be used for normalization.\nTwo human retinal endothelial cell lines were treated with medium alone or containing stimuli that included: glucose at supraphysiological concentration, dimethyloxalyl-glycine, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, lipopolysaccharide and Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. Biological response of cells was confirmed by measuring significant increase in a stimulus-relevant transcript. Total RNA was reverse transcribed and analyzed by commercial PCR arrays designed to detect 28 reference genes. Stability of reference gene expression, for each and both cell lines, and for each and all conditions, was judged on gene-stability measure (M-value) less than 0.2 and coefficient of variation (CV-value) less than 0.1.\nReference gene expression varied substantially across stimulations and between cell lines. Of 27 detectable reference genes, 11-21 (41-78%) maintained expression stability across stimuli and cell lines. Ranking indicated substantial diversity in the most stable reference genes under different conditions, and no reference gene was expressed stably under all conditions of stimulation and for both cell lines. Four reference genes were expressed stably under 5 conditions: HSP90AB1, IPO8, PSMC4 and RPLPO.\nWe observed variation in stability of reference gene expression with different stimuli and between human retinal endothelial cell lines.

Among 1089 variants in 14 genes reported in public databases, 307 variants previously suggested for pathogenicity in Mendelian diseases were comprehensively re-evaluated using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) 2015 guideline. A total of eight autosomal recessive genes were annotated as being strongly associated with specific Mendelian diseases, including two recently discovered genes (ADAMTS9 and ADAMTS19) for their causality in congenital diseases (nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy and nonsyndromic heart valve disease, respectively). Clinical symptoms and affected organs were extremely heterogeneous among hereditary diseases caused by ADAMTS family genes, indicating phenotypic heterogeneity despite their structural and functional similarity. ADAMTS6 was suggested as presenting undiscovered pathogenic mutations responsible for novel Mendelian disorders.

Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was applied to identify the gene targets of keloid scars within differentially expressed genes. Modules and hub genes for keloids were identified. Enrichment analysis was undertaken to verify the modules' and hub genes' relationship with keloids.\nEnrichment analysis and pathway analysis showed gene ontology terms and pathways related to keloids.

Three hub genes were selected for fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and their relationship to keloids was verified. Immunohistochemical staining verified expression change of some hub genes.\nThis is the first study to describe the gene networks underlying keloids. Modules and hub genes generated in the present study are highly related to keloids and may identify novel therapeutic targets for treatment of keloids.\nTherapeutic, V.\n","572":"\nIt is observed that upregulation of DNMT3B enzyme in some cancers, including colon cancer, could lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. MiR-339 and miR-766 have been predicted to target 3'UTR of DNMT3B gene. Luciferase reporter assay validated that individual and co-transfection of miR-766 and miR-339 into the HEK293T cell reduced luciferase activity to 26% \u00b1 0.41%, 43% \u00b1 0.42 and 64% \u00b1 0.52%, respectively, compared to the control (P < 0.05). Furthermore, transduction of miR-339 and miR-766 expressing viruses into colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and HCT116) decreased DNMT3B expression (1.5, 3-fold) and (3, 4-fold), respectively. In addition, DNA methylation of some tumor suppressor genes decreased. Expression of these genes such as SFRP1 (2 and 1.6-fold), SFRP2 (0.07 and 4-fold), WIF1 (0.05 and 4-fold), and DKK2 (2 and 4-fold) increased in SW-339 and SW-766 cell lines; besides, expression increments for these genes in HCT-339 and HCT-766 cell lines were (2.8, 4-fold), (0.005, 1.5-fold), (1.7 and 3-fold) and (0.04, 1.7-fold), respectively. Also, while in SW-766, cell proliferation reduced to 2.8% and 21.7% after 24 and 48\u00a0hours, respectively, SW-339 showed no reduced proliferation. Meanwhile, HCT-766 and HCT-339 showed (3.5%, 12.8%) and (18.8%, 33.9%) reduced proliferation after 24 and 48\u00a0hours, respectively. Finally, targeting DNMT3B by these miRs, decreased methylation of tumor suppressor genes such as SFRP1, SFRP2, WIF1 and DKK2 in the mentioned cell lines, and returned the expression of these tumor suppressor genes which can contribute to lethal effect on colon cancer cells and reducing tumorigenicity of these cells.\n","573":"\nThe aim of the present study was to identify genes that may serve as markers for breast cancer prognosis by constructing a gene co-expression network and mining modules associated with survival. Two gene expression datasets of breast cancer were downloaded from ArrayExpress and genes from these datasets with a coefficient of variation >0.5 were selected and underwent functional enrichment analysis with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery. Gene co-expression networks were constructed with the WGCNA package in R. Modules were identified from the network via cluster analysis. Cox regression was conducted to analyze survival rates. A total of 2,669 genes were selected, and functional enrichment analysis of them revealed that they were mainly associated with the immune response, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell adhesion. Seven modules were identified from the gene co-expression network, one of which was found to be significantly associated with patient survival time. Expression status of 144 genes from this module was used to cluster patient samples into two groups, with a significant difference in survival time revealed between these groups. These genes were involved in the cell cycle and tumor protein p53 signaling pathway. The top 10 hub genes were identified in the module. The findings of the present study could advance the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer.\n","574":"\nGastric cancer is one of the most common and lethal type of cancer worldwide. Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is recognized as the major cause of gastric cancer. However, it remains unclear the mechanism by which Helicobacter infection leads to gastric cancer. Furthermore, the underlying molecular events involved during the progression of Helicobacter infection to gastric malignancy are not well understood. In previous studies, we demonstrated that that H. felis-infected Myd88 -\/- mice exhibited dramatic pathology and an accelerated progression to gastric dysplasia; however, the MyD88 downstream gene targets responsible for this pathology have not been described. This study was designed to identify MyD88-dependent genes involved in the progression towards gastric cancer during the course of Helicobacter infection.\nWild type (WT) and Myd88 deficient mice (Myd88 -\/-) were infected with H. felis for 25 and 47\u00a0weeks and global transcriptome analysis performed on gastric tissue using MouseWG-6 v2 expression BeadChips microarrays. Function and pathway enrichment analyses of statistically significant, differential expressed genes (p\u2009<\u20090.05) were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online tools.\nHelicobacter infection affected the transcriptional profile of more genes in Myd88 -\/- mice compared to WT mice. Infection of Myd88 -\/- mice resulted in the differential expression of 1,989 genes at 25\u00a0weeks (1031 up and 958 downregulated). At 47\u00a0weeks post-H.felis infection, 2,162 (1140 up and 1022 downregulated) were differentially expressed. The most significant differentially upregulated gene during Helicobacter infection in Myd88 -\/- mice was chitinase-like 4 (chil4), which is involved in tissue remodeling and wound healing. Other highly upregulated genes in H. felis-infected Myd88 -\/- mice included, Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1 (Ido1), Guanylate binding protein 2 (Gbp2), ubiquitin D (Ubd), \u03b2 2 -Microglobulin (B2m), CD74 antigen (Cd74), which have been reported to promote cancer progression by enhancing angiogenesis, proliferation, migration, metastasis, invasion, and tumorigenecity. For downregulated genes, the highly expressed genes included, ATPase H+\/K+ transporting, alpha subunit (Atp4a), Atp4b, Mucin 5\u00a0AC (Muc5ac), Apolipoprotein A-1 (Apoa1), and gastric intrinsic factor (Gif), whose optimal function is important in maintaining gastric hemostasis and lower expression has been associated with increased risk of gastric carcinogenesis.\nThese results provide a global transcriptional gene profile during the development and progression of Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer. The data show that our mouse model system is useful for identifying genes involved in gastric cancer progression.\n","575":"\nSalt is the major factor limiting crop productivity in saline soils and is controlled by various genes. The development of salt-tolerant rice through molecular breeding methods is important to meet the needs of rice breeding. We used 295 accessions to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of salt tolerance-related phenotypes in rice at the seedling stage and obtained 93 candidate genes with high association peaks across six phenotypes. We constructed a protein interaction network using the candidate genes identified here, and 33 genes were associated. Based on the expression patterns, we found that most of these genes showed a different expression level under control and salt stress conditions. In addition, haplotype network and sequence analysis of one 'key' gene, a transcription factor (Os12g0176700) encoding a SWIRM domain-containing protein, in the interaction network was investigated to explore its possible role in the network. Our study revealed candidate salt tolerance-related genes in rice at the seedling stage, and demonstrated the feasibility of using GWAS to identify genetic architecture underlying salt tolerance. The data generated here may provide resources for molecular breeding and functional analysis of salt tolerance in rice seedlings.\n","576":"\nSugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) is a world-wide cash crop for sugar and biofuel in tropical and subtropical regions and suffers serious losses in cane yield and sugar content under salinity and drought stresses. Although real-time quantitative PCR has a numerous advantage in the expression quantification of stress-related genes for the elaboration of the corresponding molecular mechanism in sugarcane, the variation happened across the process of gene expression quantification should be normalized and monitored by introducing one or several reference genes. To validate suitable reference genes or gene sets for sugarcane gene expression normalization, 13 candidate reference genes have been tested across 12 NaCl- and PEG-treated sugarcane samples for four sugarcane genotypes using four commonly used systematic statistical algorithms termed geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and the deltaCt method. The results demonstrated that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and eukaryotic elongation factor 1-alpha (eEF-1a) were identified as suitable reference genes for gene expression normalization under salinity\/drought-treatment in sugarcane. Moreover, the expression analyses of SuSK and 6PGDH further validated that a combination of clathrin adaptor complex (CAC) and cullin (CUL) as reference should be better for gene expression normalization. These results can facilitate the future research on gene expression in sugarcane under salinity and drought stresses. \n","577":"\nTo analyze the germline variations of genes RET, VHL, SDHD and SDHB in patients with pheochromocytoma and\/or paraganglioma and to evaluate variations of these genes in Chinese patients.\nPatients who were treated in Peking University First Hospital from September 2012 to March 2014 and diagnosed with pheochromocytoma and\/or paraganglioma by pathologists were included in this study. Twelve patients were included in total, of whom 11 had pheochromocytoma, and 1 had paraganglioma. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from the leukocytes of peripheral blood of the patients. The exons 10, 11, 13-16 of the RET gene, and all exons of VHL, SDHB and SDHD genes and their nearby introns (\u00b120 bp) were amplified with polymerase chain reactions, and the products were sent to a biotechnology company for sequencing. The sequencing results were compared with wildtype sequences of these genes to identify variations. One of the patients was diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. A family analysis was performed in his kindred, and his family members received genetic tests for the related variations.\nThree patients were found to have germline gene variations. A c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene was found in a patient with malignant pheochromocytoma. A c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation, as well as c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were found in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. After a family analysis, five family members of this patient were found to have the same variations. c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were also found in a clinical sporadic patient without evidence of malignancy. A patient with congenital single ventricle malformation and pheochromocytoma was included in this study, and no variation with clinical significance was found in the four genes of this patient.\n25% (3\/12) patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma were found to have missense or nonsense germline gene variations in this study, including the c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene, the c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation of the RET gene, and c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene. The former two variations have already been confirmed to be pathogenic. The existence of these variations in Chinese patients with pheochromocytoma and\/or paraganglioma was validated in this study, which supports the conclusion that genetic testing is necessary to be generally performed in patients with pheochromocytoma and\/or paraganglioma.\n","578":"\nThe aim of the present study was to explore the molecular basis and identify significant genetic alterations in acetabular labrum cells associated with osteoarthritis (OA). Gene expression data of osteoarthritic and normal human labrum cells were downloaded from a public database and reanalyzed. Significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were acquired by performing a thorough analysis of microarray data between the OA acetabular labrum cells and control cells. Key genes in OA labrum cells were revealed by a combination of weighted gene co\u2011expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Literature mining and drug screening were further performed for these key genes. In total, 141 DEGs between OA and normal labrum cells were identified. In addition, WGCNA and PPI analysis identified 23 DEGs as key genes in the OA labrum. All the key genes were significantly downregulated in OA labrum cells and were grouped into two different WGCNA\u2011PPI common subnetworks. Kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), CD34, cadherin 5 (CDH5), Fms related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) and asporin were hub nodes in the PPI network of DEGs. These key genes were significantly enriched in functional clusters of transforming growth factor, alkaline phosphatase, bone morphogenic protein and extracellular matrix. Drug screening analysis identified several drugs targeting the key genes, including arachidonic acid, yohimbic acid and mimosine. The results of the present study indicate that the changes of FLT1, KDR, CD34 and CDH5 in acetabular labrum cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of OA and could serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets of OA. Additionally, arachidonic acid, yohimbic acid and mimosine may act as potential drugs for OA.\n","579":"\nTo study the expression of pathogenicity-related genes in Erwinia amylovora, seven candidate reference genes (ffh, glyA, gyrA, proC, pykA, recA, rpoB) were selected and validated with the following five different mathematic algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, the delta CT method and the RefFinder web-based tool. An overall comprehensive ranking output from each of the selected software programs revealed that proC and recA, followed by ffh and pykA, were the most stably expressed genes and can be recommended for the normalization of RT-qPCR data. A combination of the three reference genes, proC, recA and ffh, allowed for the accurate expression analysis of amsB and hrpN genes and the calculation of their fold change in E. amylovora after its infection of susceptible and resistant apple cultivars. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting a list of the most suitable reference genes for use in the relative quantification of target gene expression in E. amylovora in planta, selected on the basis of a multi-algorithm analysis.\n","580":"\nMethods based around statistics and linear algebra have been increasingly used in attempts to address emerging questions in microarray literature. Microarray technology is a long-used tool in the global analysis of gene expression, allowing for the simultaneous investigation of hundreds or thousands of genes in a sample. It is characterized by a low sample size and a large feature number created a non-square matrix, and by the incomplete rank, that can generate countless more solution in classifiers. To avoid the problem of the 'curse of dimensionality' many authors have performed feature selection or reduced the size of data matrix. In this work, we introduce a new logistic regression-based model to classify breast cancer tumor samples based on microarray expression data, including all features of gene expression and without reducing the microarray data matrix. If the user still deems it necessary to perform feature reduction, it can be done after the application of the methodology, still maintaining a good classification. This methodology allowed the correct classification of breast cancer sample data sets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data series GSE65194, GSE20711, and GSE25055, which contain the microarray data of said breast cancer samples. Classification had a minimum performance of 80% (sensitivity and specificity), and explored all possible data combinations, including breast cancer subtypes. This methodology highlighted genes not yet studied in breast cancer, some of which have been observed in Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). In this work we examine the patterns and features of a GRN composed of transcription factors (TFs) in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, providing valuable information regarding breast cancer. In particular, some genes whose \u03b1i\u00a0\u2217\u00a0associated parameter values revealed extreme positive and negative values, and, as such, can be identified as breast cancer prediction genes. We indicate that the PKN2, MKL1, MED23, CUL5 and GLI genes demonstrate a tumor suppressor profile, and that the MTR, ITGA2B, TELO2, MRPL9, MTTL1, WIPI1, KLHL20, PI4KB, FOLR1 and SHC1 genes demonstrate an oncogenic profile. We propose that these may serve as potential breast cancer prediction genes, and should be prioritized for further clinical studies on breast cancer. This new model allows for the assignment of values to the \u03b1i\u00a0\u2217\u00a0parameters associated with gene expression. It was noted that some \u03b1i\u00a0\u2217\u00a0parameters are associated with genes previously described as breast cancer biomarkers, as well as other genes not yet studied in relation to this disease.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The low oxygen-induced transcriptional regulator LoiA is established to be a positive regulator of SPI-1 genes and can also repress the expression of the ATP-dependent Lon protease, a negative regulator of SPI-1 genes. Whether the repression of lon by LoiA is associated with its regulation of SPI-1 genes, as well as the regulatory mechanism involved, is unknown. In this study, we showed that LoiA directly represses the expression of the lon gene during invasion by binding to the promoter region of lon. The activation of S. Typhimurium SPI-1 gene expression by LoiA is associated with its repression of lon. Moreover, through invasion and mouse infection assays, we found that the repression of lon by LoiA contributes to S. Typhimurium invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and virulence in mice. However, LoiA does not influence lon expression during S. Typhimurium growth in macrophages, which may be associated with the low expression level of loiA in macrophages. Collectively, these findings establish the direct regulation of lon by LoiA and describe a novel mechanism by which LoiA regulates SPI-1 gene expression.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Institut Pasteur.

Its genome harbors up to 5% of genes that were most likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer. These genes probably contributed to G.sulphuraria's adaptation to its extreme habitats, resulting in today's polyextremophilic traits. Here, we applied RNA-sequencing to obtain insights into the acclimation of a thermophilic organism towards temperatures below its growth optimum and to study how horizontally acquired genes contribute to cold acclimation. A decrease in growth temperature from 42\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC\/46\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC to 28\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC resulted in an upregulation of ribosome biosynthesis, while excreted proteins, probably components of the cell wall, were downregulated. Photosynthesis was suppressed at cold temperatures, and transcript abundances indicated that C-metabolism switched from gluconeogenesis to glycogen degradation. Folate cycle and S-adenosylmethionine cycle (one-carbon metabolism) were transcriptionally upregulated, probably to drive the biosynthesis of betaine. All these cold-induced changes in gene expression were reversible upon return to optimal growth temperature. Numerous genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer displayed temperature-dependent expression changes, indicating that these genes contributed to adaptive evolution in G.sulphuraria.\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The Author(s) 2018.

Although the biosynthesis pathways of secondary metabolites have been extensively studied, the regulatory mechanism of gene expression involved in these pathways remains poorly understood. In this study, we develop a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system that enables a rapid analysis of the regulatory mechanism of genes involved in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, one of the largest groups in secondary metabolites, using hydroponically-grown Nicotiana benthamiana. Using VIGS, we successfully reduced the transcript levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase 1 (HMGR1), cycloartenol synthase 1 (CAS1), sterol side chain reductase 2 (SSR2) and S-adenosyl-L-Met-dependent C-24 sterol methyltransferase 1 (SMT1) in leaf, stem and root tissues in approximately 2 weeks. We identified novel feedback and feed-forward regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis genes when CAS1, which encodes a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of sterols and steroidal glycoalkaloids, was down-regulated. Furthermore, the regulation of these genes differed among different tissues. These results demonstrate that our system can rapidly analyse the regulatory mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.\n","584":"\nInsecticidal cry and vip genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been used for control of lepidopteran insects in transgenic crops. However, novel genes are required for gene pyramiding to delay evolution of resistance to the currently deployed genes. Two PCR-based techniques were employed for screening of cry2-type genes in 129 Bt isolates from diverse habitats in India and 27 known Bt strains. cry2Ab-type genes were more prevalent than cry2Aa- and cry2Ac-type genes. Correlation between source of isolates and abundance of cry2-type genes was not observed. Full-length cry2A-type genes were amplified by PCR from 9 Bt isolates and 4 Bt strains. The genes from Bt isolates SK-758 from Sorghum grain dust and SK-793 from Chilli seeds warehouse, Andhra Pradesh, were cloned and sequenced. The gene from SK-758 (NCBI GenBank accession No. GQ866915) was novel, while that from SK-793 (NCBI GenBank accession No. GQ866914) was identical to the cry2Ab1 gene. The Bacillus thuringiensis Nomenclature Committee ( http:\/\/www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk\/home\/Neil_Crickmore\/Bt\/toxins2.html ) named these genes cry2Af2 and cry2Ab16, respectively.

Normalizing to reference gene in relative quantification make results from qPCR more reliable when compared to absolute quantification, but requires robust reference genes. Since, ideal reference gene should be species specific, no single internal control gene is universal for use as a reference gene across various plant developmental stages and diverse growth conditions. Here, we present validation studies of multiple stably expressed reference genes in cultivated peanut with minimal variations in temporal and spatial expression when subjected to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Stability in the expression of eight candidate reference genes including ADH3, ACT11, ATPsyn, CYP2, ELF1B, G6PD, LEC and UBC1 was compared in diverse peanut plant samples. The samples were categorized into distinct experimental sets to check the suitability of candidate genes for accurate and reliable normalization of gene expression using qPCR. Stability in expression of the references genes in eight sets of samples was determined by geNorm and NormFinder methods. While three candidate reference genes including ADH3, G6PD and ELF1B were identified to be stably expressed across experiments, LEC was observed to be the least stable, and hence must be avoided for gene expression studies in peanut. Inclusion of the former two genes gave sufficiently reliable results; nonetheless, the addition of the third reference gene ELF1B may be potentially better in a diverse set of tissue samples of peanut. \n","586":"\nPolyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is biodegradable and renewable and thus considered as a promising alternative to petroleum-based plastics. However, PHB production is costly due to expensive carbon sources for culturing PHB-accumulating microorganisms under sterile conditions. We discovered a hyper PHB-accumulating denitrifying bacterium, Zobellella denitrificans ZD1 (referred as strain ZD1 hereafter) capable of using non-sterile crude glycerol (a waste from biodiesel production) and nitrate to produce high PHB yield under saline conditions. Nevertheless, the underlying genetic mechanisms of PHB production in strain ZD1 have not been elucidated. In this study, we discovered a complete pathway of glycerol conversion to PHB, a novel PHB synthesis gene cluster, a salt-tolerant gene cluster, denitrifying genes, and an assimilatory nitrate reduction gene cluster in the ZD1 genome. Interestingly, the novel PHB synthesis gene cluster was found to be conserved among marine Gammaproteobacteria. Higher levels of PHB accumulation were linked to higher expression levels of the PHB synthesis gene cluster in ZD1 grown with glycerol and nitrate under saline conditions. Additionally, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas type-I-E antiviral system was found in the ZD1 genome along with a long spacer list, in which most of the spacers belong to either double-stranded DNA viruses or unknown phages.

Up to now, only one reference gene for qPCR analysis, corresponding to 40S Ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9), was available for the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus, the only source of the commercial anticancer drugs vinblastine and vincristine. Here, we screened for additional reference genes for this plant species by mining C.\u00a0roseus RNA-Seq data for orthologs of 22 genes known to be stably expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana and qualified as superior reference genes for this model plant species. Based on this, eight candidate C.\u00a0roseus reference genes were identified and, together with RPS9, evaluated by performing qPCR on a series of different C.\u00a0roseus explants and tissue cultures. NormFinder, geNorm and BestKeeper analyses of the resulting qPCR data revealed that the orthologs of At2g28390 (SAND family protein, SAND), At2g32170 (N2227-like family protein, N2227) and At4g26410 (Expressed protein, EXP) had the highest expression stability across the different C.\u00a0roseus samples and are superior as reference genes as compared to the traditionally used RPS9.

The expression profiling was verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Moreover, we determined the expression features and co-expression networks of highly variable genes. We also used the ARACNe method to obtain 263 core genes related to different biological pathways. Additionally, eight of the identified genes were aligned with transcription factor families, indicating that they act as transcription factors and regulate downstream genes.

In the present work, we screened the published gene expression data and analyzed them with integrative tool, combined with pathway and gene ontology enrichment investigation. We identified several consensus differentially expressed genes and these genes were further confirmed with literature mining; at last, two genes, that is, immunoglobulin J chain and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 17, were screened as novel gastric cancer associated genes. Experimental validation is proposed to further confirm this finding.\n","590":"\nOne of the best and most accurate methods for identifying disease-causing genes is monitoring gene expression values in different samples using microarray technology. One of the shortcomings of microarray data is that they provide a small quantity of samples with respect to the number of genes. This problem reduces the classification accuracy of the methods, so gene selection is essential to improve the predictive accuracy and to identify potential marker genes for a disease. Among numerous existing methods for gene selection, support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVMRFE) has become one of the leading methods, but its performance can be reduced because of the small sample size, noisy data and the fact that the method does not remove redundant genes.\nWe propose a novel framework for gene selection which uses the advantageous features of conventional methods and addresses their weaknesses. In fact, we have combined the Fisher method and SVMRFE to utilize the advantages of a filtering method as well as an embedded method. Furthermore, we have added a redundancy reduction stage to address the weakness of the Fisher method and SVMRFE. In addition to gene expression values, the proposed method uses Gene Ontology which is a reliable source of information on genes. The use of Gene Ontology can compensate, in part, for the limitations of microarrays, such as having a small number of samples and erroneous measurement results.\nThe proposed method has been applied to colon, Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and prostate cancer datasets. The empirical results show that our method has improved classification performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the study of the molecular function of selected genes strengthened the hypothesis that these genes are involved in the process of cancer growth.\nThe proposed method addresses the weakness of conventional methods by adding a redundancy reduction stage and utilizing Gene Ontology information. It predicts marker genes for colon, DLBCL and prostate cancer with a high accuracy. The predictions made in this study can serve as a list of candidates for subsequent wet-lab verification and might help in the search for a cure for cancers.\n","591":"\nWatermelon is one of the major Cucurbitaceae crops and the recent availability of genome sequence greatly facilitates the fundamental researches on it. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is the preferred method for gene expression analyses, and using validated reference genes for normalization is crucial to ensure the accuracy of this method. However, a systematic validation of reference genes has not been conducted on watermelon. In this study, transcripts of 15 candidate reference genes were quantified in watermelon using qRT-PCR, and the stability of these genes was compared using geNorm and NormFinder. geNorm identified ClTUA and ClACT, ClEF1\u03b1 and ClACT, and ClCAC and ClTUA as the best pairs of reference genes in watermelon organs and tissues under normal growth conditions, abiotic stress, and biotic stress, respectively. NormFinder identified ClYLS8, ClUBCP, and ClCAC as the best single reference genes under the above experimental conditions, respectively. ClYLS8 and ClPP2A were identified as the best reference genes across all samples. Two to nine reference genes were required for more reliable normalization depending on the experimental conditions. The widely used watermelon reference gene 18SrRNA was less stable than the other reference genes under the experimental conditions. Catalase family genes were identified in watermelon genome, and used to validate the reliability of the identified reference genes. ClCAT1and ClCAT2 were induced and upregulated in the first 24 h, whereas ClCAT3 was downregulated in the leaves under low temperature stress. However, the expression levels of these genes were significantly overestimated and misinterpreted when 18SrRNA was used as a reference gene.

Unfertilized eggs from five different stages of early development were used to detect the changing situation of gene expression. The expressed genes showed different patterns over time. Seventy-six maternal genes were annotated according to homology analysis with Drosophila melanogaster. More than half of the differentially expressed maternal genes fell into four expression patterns, while the expression patterns showed a downward trend over time. The functional annotation of these material genes was mainly related to transcription factor activity, growth factor activity, nucleic acid binding, RNA binding, ATP binding, and ion binding. Additionally, twenty-two gene clusters including maternal genes were identified from 18 scaffolds. Altogether, we plotted a profile for the maternal genes of Bombyx mori using a digital gene expression profiling method. This will provide the basis for maternal-specific signature research and improve the understanding of the early development of silkworm.\n","593":"\nType II melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE) are a subgroup of about a dozen proteins found in various locations in the genome and expressed in normal tissues, thus are not related to cancer as the type I MAGE genes. This gene family exists as a single copy in non-mammals and monotremata, but found as two copies in metatherians and occur as a diverse group in all eutherians. Our studies suggest MAGED2 as the ancestor of this subfamily and the most likely evolutionary history of eutherian type II MAGE genes is hereby proposed based on synteny conservation, phylogenetic relations, genome location, homology conservation, and the protein and gene structures. Type II genes can be divided into two: those with 13 exons (MAGED1, MAGED2, TRO, and MAGED4) and those with only one exon (MAGEE1, MAGEE2, MAGEF1, NSMCE3, MAGEH1, MAGEL2, and NDN) with different evolutionary patterns. Our results suggest a need to change the gene nomenclature to MAGE1 (the ancestral gene), currently designated as LOC103095671 and LOC100935086, in opossum and Tasmanian devil, respectively, and MAGE2 (the duplicated one), currently designated as LOC100617402 and NDNL2, respectively, to avoid confusion. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among 23 mammalian species using the combined sequences of MAGED1, MAGED2, MAGEL2, and NDN, because of their high divergence, and found high levels of support, being able to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, Afrotheria, and Xenarthra, as an example that small, but phylogenetically informative sequences, can be very useful for resolving basal mammalian clades.\n","594":"\nWith large-scale population sequencing projects gathering pace, there is a need for strategies that advance disease gene prioritization1,2. Metrics that provide information about a gene and its ability to tolerate protein-altering variation can aid in clinical interpretation of human genomes and can advance disease gene discovery1-4. Previous reported methods analyzed the total variant load in a gene1-4, but did not analyze the distribution pattern of variants within a gene. Using data from 138,632 exome and genome sequences2, we developed gene variation intolerance rank (GeVIR), a continuous gene-level metric for 19,361 genes that is able to prioritize both dominant and recessive Mendelian disease genes5, that outperforms missense constraint metrics3 and that is comparable-but complementary-to loss-of-function (LOF) constraint metrics2. GeVIR is also able to prioritize short genes, for which LOF constraint cannot be estimated with confidence2. The majority of the most intolerant genes identified here have no defined phenotype and are candidates for severe dominant disorders.\n","595":"\nReproduction is a complex physiological process that is regulated by multiple genes and pathways. Compared with studies of common livestock, fewer studies of genes related to the fertility of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been reported, and the molecular mechanism of their high productivity is still poorly understood. To identify candidate genes associated with development and prolificacy in rabbits, we analyzed gene expression differences among the ovaries of mature Californian rabbit (LC), and mature (HH) and immature Harbin white rabbit (IH) using digital gene expression technology. We detected 885 and 321 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in comparisons between HH\/IH and HH\/LC, respectively. The functions of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined by GO classification and KEGG pathway analysis. The results suggest that most of the DEGs between the mature and immature developmental stages were predominantly associated with DNA replication, cell cycle, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and most were up-regulated in the IH group compared with the HH group. The DEGs involved in disparate fecundities between HH and LC were associated with reproduction, fructose and mannose metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and pyruvate metabolism. Our results will contribute to a better understanding of changes in the regulatory network in ovary at different developmental stages and in different fertility of rabbit.\n","596":"\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of the horizontal transfer of genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides (aac(6')-Ie-aph(2\u2033)-Ia, aph(2\u2033)-Ib, aph(2\u2033)-Ic, aph(2\u2033)-Id, ant(4')-Ia and ant(6')-Ia), tetracyclines (tetM, tetL, tetK, tetO and tetW), and macrolides (ermA, ermB, ermC, msrC, mefAB) in Enterococcus strains isolated from ready-to-eat dishes purchased in bars and restaurants in Olsztyn, Poland.\nIt was found that 74% of tested strains were able to conjugal transfer at least one of the antibiotic resistance genes. Transfer of resistance to tetracyclines in strains was observed with a frequency ranging from 1.3 \u00d7 10-6 to 8.7 \u00d7 10-7 transconjugants\/donor. The int gene and the tetM gene were transferred simultaneously, which indicated that a transposon of the Tn916\/Tn1545 also participated in the conjugation process. The frequency of transferring genes of resistance to macrolides ranged from 3.2 \u00d7 10-6 to 2.4 \u00d7 10-8 transconjugants\/donor. The ermB gene was transferred the most frequently. The frequency of acquisition of genes encoding aminoglycosides in strains isolated from food ranged from 1.7 \u00d7 10-6 to 3,2 \u00d7 10-8 transconjugants\/donor. Transfer of the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2\u2033) gene was the most frequent. In all reactions, the clonal character of transconjugants and recipients was confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction melting profile (PCR MP) method, which is an alternative to the pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method.\nThe findings of this study indicate that Enterococcus isolated from ready-to-eat food is able to horizontally transfer genes encoding various antibiotic resistance mechanisms. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.\n\u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.\n","597":"\nThis study aimed to explore the underlying microRNA (miRNA) targets in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The expression profile with accession number GSE24952 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Based on the dataset, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs in ccRCC tissues and matched normal adjacent tissues were analyzed. The target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were then predicted. Expression levels of several key miRNAs and genes were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 168 up- and 288 downregulated DEGs, and 26 up- and 54 downregulated differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. The target genes of miRNA-429 (TGFB1, CCND1, EGFR, and LAMC1) and miRNA-206 (CCND1 and EGFR) were upregulated. Based on the tumor suppressor (TS) gene and tumor-associated gene (TAG) databases, miRNA-142-5p was selected from the upregulated miRNAs. miRNA-429, miRNA-422a, miRNA-206, miRNA-132-3p, and miRNA-184 were selected from the downregulated miRNAs. Moreover, the miRNA regulation network revealed that CCND1 was the common target gene of miRNA-429, miRNA-206, and miRNA-184, and ATP1B1 was the common target gene of miRNA-140-3p and miRNA-142-5p. qRT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of miR-140-3p and CCND1 significantly increased, while that of ATP1B1 significantly decreased in 786-O cells compared with those in human renal tubular epithelial cells, which was in accordance with the predicted results of bioinformatic analysis. In conclusion, miRNA-429, miRNA-206, and miRNA-184 and their target gene CCND1, as well as miRNA-140-3p and miRNA-142-5p and their target gene ATP1B1, might play key roles in ccRCC progression and could be useful biomarkers during ccRCC development.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While genomic assays can identify putative enhancers en masse, assigning target genes is a complex challenge. We devised a machine learning approach, McEnhancer, which links target genes to putative enhancers via a semi-supervised learning algorithm that predicts gene expression patterns based on enriched sequence features. Predicted expression patterns were 73-98% accurate, predicted assignments showed strong Hi-C interaction enrichment, enhancer-associated histone modifications were evident, and known functional motifs were recovered. Our model provides a general framework to link globally identified enhancers to targets and contributes to deciphering the regulatory genome.\n","599":"\nThe Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is a dominant aquaculture species in many intertidal zones throughout the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and can tolerate a wide range of salinity. Studying the gene expression profiles of oyster gills had found differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in salinity tolerance. A systematic study of cellular response to salinity stress may provide insights into the mechanism of acquired salinity tolerance. Here, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was carried out using RNA-seq data from gill transcriptome in response to different salinity. A total of 25,463 genes were parsed into 22 gene modules, of which 5 gene modules were identified as salinity-related modules. Brown module was the only one significantly correlated with salinity and free amino acids (FAAs) contents, which was associated with cellular metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, oxidation reduction, electron transport, nitrogen compound metabolism, and others. The enriched pathways in brown module were mainly about FAAs metabolism. The other four modules were significantly correlated with certain FAAs, and were over-represented in certain salinity. These results indicated that C. gigas triggered different FAAs in different salinity stress. This study represents the first RNA-seq gene network analysis in oysters responding to different salinity stresses. These results provide a systems-level framework to help understand the complexity of cellular process in response to osmotic stress and show the function and regulated genes of different FAAs at the molecular level.\n","600":"\nHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the stable transmission of genetic material between organisms by means other than vertical inheritance. HGT has an important role in the evolution of prokaryotes but is relatively rare in eukaryotes. HGT has been shown to contribute to virulence in eukaryotic pathogens. We studied the importance of HGT in plant pathogenic fungi by identifying horizontally transferred genes in the genomes of three members of the genus Colletotrichum.\nWe identified eleven HGT events from bacteria into members of the genus Colletotrichum or their ancestors. The HGT events include genes involved in amino acid, lipid and sugar metabolism as well as lytic enzymes. Additionally, the putative minimal dates of transference were calculated using a time calibrated phylogenetic tree. This analysis reveals a constant flux of genes from bacteria to fungi throughout the evolution of subphylum Pezizomycotina.\nGenes that are typically transferred by HGT are those that are constantly subject to gene duplication and gene loss. The functions of some of these genes suggest roles in niche adaptation and virulence. We found no evidence of a burst of HGT events coinciding with major geological events. In contrast, HGT appears to be a constant, albeit rare phenomenon in the Pezizomycotina, occurring at a steady rate during their evolution.\n","601":"\nPseudogenes, the 'genomic fossils' present portrayal of evolutionary history of human genome. The human genes configuring pseudogenes are also now coming forth as important resources in the study of human protein evolution. In this communication, we explored evolutionary conservation of the genes forming pseudogenes over the genes lacking any pseudogene and delving deeper, we probed an evolutionary rate difference between the disease genes in the two groups. We illustrated this differential evolutionary pattern by gene expressivity, number of regulatory miRNA targeting per gene, abundance of protein complex forming genes and lesser percentage of protein intrinsic disorderness. Furthermore, pseudogenes are observed to harbor sequence variations, over their entirety, those become degenerative disease-causing mutations though the disease involvement of their progenitors is still unexplored. Here, we unveiled an immense association of disease genes in the genes casting pseudogenes in human. We interpreted the issue by disease associated miRNA targeting, genes containing polymorphisms in miRNA target sites, abundance of genes having disease causing non-synonymous mutations, disease gene specific network properties, presence of genes having repeat regions, affluence of dosage sensitive genes and the presence of intrinsically unstructured protein regions.\nCopyright \u00a9 2012.

We searched curated datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and identified 13 and five expression studies of diabetes and insulin responses at various tissues, respectively. We tested differential gene expression by empirical Bayes-based linear method and investigated gene set expression association by knowledge-based enrichment analysis. Meta-analysis by different methods was applied to identify tissue non-specific genes and gene sets. We also proposed pathway mapping analysis to infer functions of the identified gene sets, and correlation and independent analysis to evaluate expression association profile of genes and gene sets between studies and tissues. Our analysis showed that PGRMC1 and HADH genes were significant over diabetes studies, while IRS1 and MPST genes were significant over insulin response studies, and joint analysis showed that HADH and MPST genes were significant over all combined data sets. The pathway analysis identified six significant gene sets over all studies. The KEGG pathway mapping indicated that the significant gene sets are related to diabetes pathogenesis. The results also presented that 12.8% and 59.0% pairwise studies had significantly correlated expression association for genes and gene sets, respectively; moreover, 12.8% pairwise studies had independent expression association for genes, but no studies were observed significantly different for expression association of gene sets. Our analysis indicated that there are both tissue specific and non-specific genes and pathways associated with diabetes pathogenesis. Compared to the gene expression, pathway association tends to be tissue non-specific, and a common pathway influencing diabetes development is activated through different genes at different tissues.\n","603":"\nProstate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is a common malignant tumor in elderly men. Our research uses The Cancer Gene Atlas (TCGA) database to find potential related genes for predicting the prognosis of patients with PRAD.\nWe downloaded gene expression profiles and clinical sample information from TCGA for 490 patients with PRAD (patient age: 41-78 years). We calculated stromal and immune scores using the ESTIMATE algorithm to predict the level of stromal and immune cell infiltration. We categorized patients with PRAD in TCGA into high and low score arrays according to their median immune\/stromal scores and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significantly correlated with the prognosis of PRAD. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. The association between DEGs and overall survival was investigated by weighted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) of DEGs was constructed using the STRING tool. Finally, the hub genes were identified by analyzing the degree of association of PPI networks.\nWe found that 8 individual DEGs, C6, S100A12, MLC1, PAX5, C7, FAM162B, CAMK1G, and TCEAL5, were significantly predictive of favorable overall survival and one DEG, EPYC, was associated with poor overall survival. GO and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that the DEGs were associated with immune responses. Moreover, 30 hub genes were obtained using the PPI network of DEGs: ITGAM, CD4, CD3E, IL-10, LCP2, ITGB2, ZAP-70, C3, CCL19, CXCL13, CXCL9, BTK, CCL21, CD247, CD28, CD3D, FCER1G, PTPRC, TYROBP, CCR5, ITK, CCL13, CCR1, CCR2, CD79B, CYBB, IL2RG, JAK3, PLCG2, and CD19. These prominent nodes had the most associations with other genes, indicating that they might play crucial roles in the prognosis of PRAD.\nWe extracted a list of genes associated with the prostate adenocarcinoma microenvironment, which might contribute to the prediction and interpretation of PRAD prognosis.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Xin Zhao et al.\n","604":"\nBACKGROUND Keratitis is a complex condition in humans and is the second most common cause of legal blindness worldwide. MATERIAL AND METHODS To reveal the genomic loci underlying keratitis, we performed functional annotations of SNP-based and gene-based genome-wide association studies of keratitis in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort with 337 199 subjects of European ancestry. RESULTS The publicly available SNP-based association results showed a total of 34 SNPs, from 14 distinct loci, associated with keratitis in the UKB. Gene-based association analysis identified 2 significant genes: IQCF3 (p=2.0\u00d710\u207b\u2076) and SOD3 (p=2.0\u00d710\u207b\u2076). Thirty-two candidate genes were then prioritized using information from multiple sources. The overlap of IQCF3 in these 2 analyses resulted in a total of 33 hub genes. Functional annotation of hub genes was performed and transcriptional factors of IQCF3 and SOD3 were predicted. CONCLUSIONS A total of 34 SNPs from 14 distinct loci were identified as being associated with keratitis, and 32 candidate genes were then prioritized. In addition, IQCF3 and SOD3 were identified by their p values through gene-based tests on the basis of individual SNP-based tests. The functional relationship between these suspect genes and keratitis suggest that IQCF3 and SOD3 are candidate genes underlying keratitis.\n","605":"\nSelection on synonymous codon usage for translation efficiency and\/or accuracy has been identified as a widespread mechanism in many living organisms. However, it remains unknown whether translational selection associates closely with gene age and acts differentially on genes with different evolutionary ages. To address this issue, here we investigate the strength of translational selection acting on different aged genes in human. Our results show that old genes present stronger translational selection than young genes, demonstrating that translational selection correlates positively with gene age. We further explore the difference of translational selection in duplicates vs. singletons and in housekeeping vs. tissue-specific genes. We find that translational selection acts comparably in old singletons and old duplicates and stronger translational selection in old genes is contributed primarily by housekeeping genes. For young genes, contrastingly, singletons experience stronger translational selection than duplicates, presumably due to redundant function of duplicated genes during their early evolutionary stage. Taken together, our results indicate that translational selection acting on a gene would not be constant during all stages of evolution, associating closely with gene age. \nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, it is necessary to explore the tumorigenesis and tumor progression of HCC to discover new biomarkers for clinical treatment. We performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to explore hub genes that have high correlation with clinical information. In this study, we found 13 hub genes (GTSE1, PLK1, NCAPH, SKA3, LMNB2, SPC25, HJURP, DEPDC1B, CDCA4, UBE2C, LMNB1, PRR11, and SNRPD2) that have high correlation with histologic grade in HCC by analyzing TCGA LIHC dataset. All of these 13 hub genes could be used to effectively distinguish high histologic grade from low histologic grade of HCC through analysis of the ROC curve. The overall survival and disease-free survival information showed that high expression of these 13 hub genes led to poor prognosis. Meanwhile, these 13 hub genes had significantly different expression in HCC tumor and non-tumor tissues. We downloaded GSE6764, which contains corresponding clinical information, to validate the expression of these 13 hub genes. At the same time, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to validate the differences in the expression tendencies of these 13 hub genes between HCC tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues and high histologic grade and low histologic grade. We also explored mutation and methylation information of these 13 hub genes for further study. In summary, 13 hub genes correlated with the progression and prognosis of HCC were discovered by WGCNA in our study, and these hub genes may contribute to the tumorigenesis and tumor progression of HCC.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Gu, Li, Guo, Chen, Liu, Xiao, Yang, Liu and Liu.\n","607":"\nThe young leaves generally accumulate a certain concentration anthocyanins in the dominant species of the subtropical forest, and the changes of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme genes expression levels had an important effect on the study photoprotection of anthocyanins in the young leaves of subtropical forests. The determination of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme gene sequences and the selection of appropriate reference genes provide a basis for analyzing the functional properties of anthocyanins. In this study, four dominant subtropical forest species (i.e., Schima superba, Castanopsis fissa, Acmena acuminatissima, Cryptocarya concinna) were taken as materials. To obtain the correct nucleotide sequences of anthocyanin-related enzymes, the nucleotide sequences of CHS, DFR and ANS in each dominant species were obtained by sequencing and comparison. Then, to select the most stable reference genes for leaves at different developmental stages and different light conditions, the expression levels of six reference genes, including 18S, Actin, GAPDH, TUB, EF1 and UBQ, were studied by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and reference gene stability was analyzed by GeNorm and NormFinder software. The results showed that the expression level of Actin was the most stable in S. superba, A. acuminatissima and C. concinna, and the expression level of GAPDH was the most stable in C. fissa. Finally, the expression levels of the anthocyanin synthesis genes CHS, DFR and ANS were analyzed and found to be consistent with the accumulation trend of anthocyanins in leaves. This study has important theoretical and practical significance for future research into the expression of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme genes in the dominant tree species in subtropical forests and reveals that anthocyanin has a photoprotective effect for young leaves in high-light environments.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Gene expression microarray data have provided some insights into the molecular mechanisms of IPF. This study aimed to identify key genes and significant signaling pathways involved in IPF using bioinformatics analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using integrated analysis of gene expression data with a robust rank aggregation (RRA) method. The Connectivity Map (CMAP) was used to identify gene-expression signatures associated with IPF. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore the functional modules involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. RESULTS A total of 191 patients with IPF and 101 normal controls from six genome-wide expression datasets were included. CMAP predicted several small molecular agents as potential gene targets in IPF. Several functional modules were detected that showed the highest correlation with IPF, including an extracellular matrix (ECM) component, and a myeloid leukocyte migration and activation component involved in the immune response. Hub genes were identified in the key functional modules that might have a role in the progression of IPF. CONCLUSIONS WGCNA was used to identify functional modules and hub genes involved in the pathogenesis of IPF.\n","609":"\nEpigenetic modifications have an important role to explain part of the intra- and inter-species variation in gene expression. They also have a role in the control of transposable elements (TEs) whose activity may have a significant impact on genome evolution by promoting various mutations, which are expected to be mostly deleterious. A change in the local epigenetic landscape associated with the presence of TEs is expected to affect the expression of neighboring genes since these modifications occurring at TE sequences can spread to neighboring sequences. In this work, we have studied how the epigenetic modifications of genes are conserved and what the role of TEs is in this conservation. For that, we have compared the conservation of the epigenome associated with human duplicated genes and the differential presence of TEs near these genes. Our results show higher epigenome conservation of duplicated genes from the same family when they share similar TE environment, suggesting a role for the differential presence of TEs in the evolutionary divergence of duplicates through variation in the epigenetic landscape.\n","610":"\nIn the recent years, bioinformatics methods have been reported with a high degree of success for candidate gene identification. In this milieu, we have used an integrated bioinformatics approach assimilating information from gene ontologies (GO), protein-protein interaction (PPI) and network analysis to predict candidate genes related to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A total of 40973 PPIs were considered for 4704 cancer-related genes to construct human cancer gene network (HCGN). The importance of each node was measured in HCGN by ten different centrality measures. We have shown that the top ranking genes are related to a significantly higher number of diseases as compared to other genes in HCGN. A total of 39 candidate oral cancer target genes were predicted by combining top ranked genes and the genes corresponding to significantly enriched oral cancer related GO terms. Initial verification using literature and available experimental data indicated that 29 genes were related with OSCC. A detailed pathway analysis led us to propose a role for the selected candidate genes in the invasion and metastasis in OSCC. We further validated our predictions using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and found that the gene FLNA was upregulated while the genes ARRB1 and HTT were downregulated in the OSCC tissue samples.\n","611":"\nThe incidence of thyroid cancer and its associated morbidity has shown the most rapid increase among all cancers since 1982, but the mechanisms involved in thyroid cancer, particularly significant key genes induced in thyroid cancer, remain undefined. In many studies, gene probes have been used to search for key genes involved in causing and facilitating thyroid cancer. As a result, many possible virulence genes and pathways have been identified. However, these studies lack a case contrast for selecting the most possible virulence genes and pathways, as well as conclusive results with which to clarify the mechanisms of cancer development. In the present study, we used gene set enrichment and meta-analysis to select key genes and pathways. Based on gene set enrichment, we identified 5 downregulated and 4 upregulated mixed pathways in 6 tissue datasets. Based on the meta-analysis, there were 17 common pathways in the tissue datasets. One pathway, the p53 signaling pathway, which includes 13 genes, was identified by both the gene set enrichment analysis and meta-analysis. Genes are important elements that form key pathways. These pathways can induce the development of thyroid cancer later in life. The key pathways and genes identified in the present study can be used in the next stage of research, which will involve gene elimination and other methods of experimentation.\n","612":"\nCancer surgery may represent a potential risk of enhanced growth and metastatic ability of residual cancer cells due to post-operative immune dysfunction. This study identifies changes in transcription of genes involved in immune surveillance, immune suppression and carcinogenesis in the post-operative period of laparoscopic colon-cancer surgery within an ERAS regime.\nPatients undergoing elective, curatively intended laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer stage I-III UICC were included in the study. Patients followed standard of care in an ERAS setting. Whole blood gene expression profiling (WBGP) was performed on the day prior to surgery and 1, 2, 3 and 10-14 days after surgery. Samples were collected in Paxgene tubes and Labeled cDNA was fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip\u2122 2.0. Results were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the false discovery rate. Pathway analysis was performed through the Molecular Signature Database. Paired fold changes of gene expression were calculated for post-operative compared to pre-operative samples. A mixed effect model was used to test differential gene expression by repeated-measures ANOVA.\nWBGP of 33,804 genes at five timepoints in six patients showed 302 significantly differentially expressed genes between samples from the day prior to surgery and the day after surgery. Pathway gene enrichment analysis showed a downregulation of immunologically relevant pathways. There was a significant downregulation of genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling, antigen presentation and NK-cell activity after surgery. Furthermore, there was an upregulation of cytokines related to metastatic ability, growth and angiogenesis.\nWhole blood gene expression profiling revealed dysregulation of genes involved in immune surveillance, inflammation and carcinogenesis, after laparoscopic colon cancer surgery.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Local and global noise was added to the gene expression dataset to produce a benchmarked dataset. Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between patients with glaucoma and normal controls were identified utilizing the Linear Models for Microarray Data (Limma) package based on benchmarked dataset. A total of 5 GRN inference methods, including Zscore, GeneNet, context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm, Partial Correlation coefficient with Information Theory (PCIT) and GEne Network Inference with Ensemble of Trees (Genie3) were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision and recall (PR) curves. The interference method with the best performance was selected to construct the GRN. Subsequently, topological centrality (degree, closeness and betweenness) was conducted to identify key genes in the GRN of glaucoma. Finally, the key genes were validated by performing reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). A total of 176 DEGs were detected from the benchmarked dataset. The ROC and PR curves of the 5 methods were analyzed and it was determined that Genie3 had a clear advantage over the other methods; thus, Genie3 was used to construct the GRN. Following topological centrality analysis, 14 key genes for glaucoma were identified, including IL6, EPHA2 and GSTT1 and 5 of these 14 key genes were validated by RT-qPCR. Therefore, the current study identified 14 key genes in glaucoma, which may be potential biomarkers to use in the diagnosis of glaucoma and aid in identifying the molecular mechanism of this disease.\n","615":"\nHeavy metal contamination presents serious threats to living organisms. Functional genes related to cadmium (Cd) hypertolerance or hyperaccumulation must be explored to enhance phytoremediation. Sedum alfredii Hance is a Zn\/Cd cohyperaccumulator exhibiting abundant genes associated with Cd hypertolerance. Here, we developed a method for screening genes related to Cd tolerance by expressing a cDNA-library for S. alfredii Hance. Yeast functional complementation validated 42 of 48 full-length genes involved in Cd tolerance, and the majority of them were strongly induced in roots and exhibited diverse expression profiles across tissues. Coexpression network analysis suggested that 15 hub genes were connected with genes involved in metabolic processes, response to stimuli, and metal transporter and antioxidant activity. The functions of a novel SaCTP2 gene were validated by heterologous expression in Arabidopsis, responsible for retarding chlorophyll content decrease, maintaining membrane integrity, promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger activities, and reducing ROS levels. Our findings suggest a highly complex network of genes related to Cd hypertolerance in S. alfredii Hance, accomplished via the antioxidant system, defense genes induction, and the calcium signaling pathway. The proposed cDNA-library method is an effective approach for mining candidate genes associated with Cd hypertolerance to develop genetically engineered plants for use in phytoremediation.\n","616":"\nReverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a rapid, reliable and widely used method of studying gene expression profiles that requires appropriate normalization for accurate and reliable results. Reference genes are usually used to normalize mRNA levels; however, the expression levels of these reference genes may vary between cell types, developmental stages, species and experimental conditions. Therefore, a normalization strategy is an important precondition for reliable conclusions, with endogenous controls requiring determination for every experimental system. In the present study, 18 reference genes used in various prior studies were analyzed to determine their applicability in bladder cancer. A total of 35 matched malignant and non-malignant bladder cancer (specifically transitional cell carcinoma) tissue specimens were examined. RNA and cDNA quality was stringently controlled. Candidate reference genes were assessed using SYBR-Green RT-qPCR. mRNA abundance was compared and reference genes with distinct ranges of expression to possible target genes were excluded. Genes that were differentially expressed in matched non-cancerous and cancerous samples were also excluded, using quantification cycle analysis. Subsequently, the stability of the selected reference genes was analyzed using three different methods: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. The rarely used ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23) was the most stable single reference gene, with RPS23, tumor protein, translationally controlled 1 and RPS13 comprising the optimal reference gene set for all the bladder samples. These stable reference genes should be employed in normalization and quantification of transcript levels in future expression studies of bladder cancer-associated genes.\n","617":"\nWe previously reported that regenerating islet-derived protein 3 alpha (REG3A) exacerbates pancreatic malignancies. The mechanism of this effect has not been clearly elucidated. Here we first identified key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and signal pathways in the pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990, compared to two control cell lines, by microarray analysis. We then identified key genes and pathways regulated by REG3A or the cytokine IL6 in SW1990 cells. Afterwards, these DEGs induced by REG3A or IL6 were subjected to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and GO function analysis by the DAVID online tool. Ultimately, we constructed protein-protein interaction networks among the DEGs by Cytoscape. Among the three pancreatic cell lines, SW1990 exhibited highly deterioration with the activation of genes and pathways related to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and invasion. As a result, 50 DEGs enriched in 11 pathways were identified in REG3A-treated SW1990 cells, and 28 DEGs enriched in 9 pathways were detected in IL6-treated cells. Overall, results of microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting suggest that REG3A regulates pancreatic cell growth by increasing the expression of at least 8 genes: JAK1, STAT3, IL10, FOXM1, KRAS, MYC, CyclinD1, and c-fos; and activation of at least 4 signal pathways: TGF\u03b2, PDGF, angiogenesis and RAS. Similar results were obtained with IL6 treatment. Regulation network analysis confirmed the cell growth related DEGs, and further uncovered three transcription factor families with immune functions regulated by REG3A. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It provides a scaffold that allows the development and growth of the plant to occur in an ordered fashion. Cellulose also provides mechanical strength, which is crucial for both normal development and to enable the plant to withstand both abiotic and biotic stresses. We quantified the cellulose concentration in the culm of 288 two--rowed and 288 six--rowed spring type barley accessions that were part of the USDA funded barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) program in the USA. When the population structure of these accessions was analysed we identified six distinct populations, four of which we considered to be comprised of a sufficient number of accessions to be suitable for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These lines had been genotyped with 3072 SNPs so we combined the trait and genetic data to carry out GWAS. The analysis allowed us to identify regions of the genome containing significant associations between molecular markers and cellulose concentration data, including one region cross-validated in multiple populations. To identify candidate genes we assembled the gene content of these regions and used these to query a comprehensive RNA-seq based gene expression atlas. This provided us with gene annotations and associated expression data across multiple tissues, which allowed us to formulate a supported list of candidate genes that regulate cellulose biosynthesis. Several regions identified by our analysis contain genes that are co-expressed with cellulose synthase A (HvCesA) across a range of tissues and developmental stages. These genes are involved in both primary and secondary cell wall development. In addition, genes that have been previously linked with cellulose synthesis by biochemical methods, such as HvCOBRA, a gene of unknown function, were also associated with cellulose levels in the association panel. Our analyses provide new insights into the genes that contribute to cellulose content in cereal culms and to a greater understanding of the interactions between them.\n","619":"\nConogethes pinicolalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is similar to Conogethes punctiferalis (yellow peach moth) and its host plant is gymnosperms, especially for masson pine. So far, less literature was reported on this pest. In the present study, we sequenced and characterized the antennal transcriptomes of male and female C. pinicolalis for the first time.\nTotally, 26 odorant-binding protein (OBP) genes, 19 chemosensory protein (CSP) genes, 55 odorant receptor (OR) genes and 20 ionotropic receptor (IR) genes were identified from the C. pinicolalis antennae transcriptome and amino sequences were annotated against homologs of C. punctiferalis. The neighbor-joining tree indicated that the amino acid sequence of olfactory related genes is highly homologous with C. punctiferalis. Furthermore, the reference genes were selected, and we recommended the phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) or ribosomal protein 49 gene (RP49) to verify the target gene expression during larval development stages and RP49 or ribosomal protein L13 gene (RPL13) for adult tissues.\nOur study provides a starting point on the molecular level characterization between C. pinicolalis and C. punctiferalis, which might be supportive for pest management studies in future.\n","620":"\nLong-established protein-coding genes may lose their coding potential during evolution (\"unitary gene loss\"). Members of the Poaceae family are a major food source and represent an ideal model clade for plant evolution research. However, the global pattern of unitary gene loss in Poaceae genomes as well as the evolutionary fate of lost genes are still less-investigated and remain largely elusive.\nUsing a locally developed pipeline, we identified 129 unitary gene loss events for long-established protein-coding genes from four representative species of Poaceae, i.e. brachypodium, rice, sorghum and maize. Functional annotation suggested that the lost genes in all or most of Poaceae species are enriched for genes involved in development and response to endogenous stimulus. We also found that 44 mutated genomic loci of lost genes, which we referred as relics, were still actively transcribed, and of which 84% (37 of 44) showed significantly differential expression across different tissues. More interestingly, we found that there were totally five expressed relics may function as competitive endogenous RNA in brachypodium, rice and sorghum genome.\nBased on comparative genomics and transcriptome data, we firstly compiled a comprehensive catalogue of unitary gene loss events in Poaceae species and characterized a statistically significant functional preference for these lost genes as well showed the potential of relics functioning as competitive endogenous RNAs in Poaceae genomes.\n","621":"\nGestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) has a high incidence of pregnancy, which seriously affects the life quality of pregnant women and fetal health. DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic modification that can regulate the gene expression level, and thus affect the occurrence of various diseases. Increasing evidence has shown that gene expression changes caused by DNA methylation play an important role in metabolic diseases. Here we explored the mechanisms and biological processes that affect the occurrence and development of GDM through analyzing the gene expression profiles and DNA methylation data of GDM. We detected 24,577 differential CpG sites mapping to 9339 genes (DMGs, differential methylation gene) and 931 differential expressed genes (DEGs) between normal samples and GDM samples. GO (gene ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis of 326 overlapping genes between DMGs and DEGs showed obvious enrichment in terms related to metabolic disorders and immune responses. We identified Oas1, Ppie, Polr2g as possible pathogenic target genes of GDM by combining protein-protein interaction analysis. Our study provides possible targets for early diagnosis of GDM and information for clinical prevention of abnormal fetal development and type 2 diabetes.\n","622":"\nOsteosarcoma is a common and highly malignant tumour in children and teenagers that is characterized by drug resistance and high metastatic potential. Patients often develop pulmonary metastasis and have a low survival rate. However, the mechanistic basis for pulmonary metastasis remains unclear. To identify key gene and pathways associated with pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma, the authors downloaded the gene expression dataset GSE85537 and obtained the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by analyzing high\u2011throughput gene expression in primary tumours and lung metastases. Subsequently, the authors performed gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses and a protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and analyzed by Cytoscape software. In total, 2,493 genes were identified as DEGs. Of these, 485 genes (19.45%) were upregulated, and the remaining 2,008 genes (80.55%) were downregulated. The authors identified the predominant GO categories and KEGG pathways that were significantly over\u2011represented in the metastatic OS samples compared with the non\u2011metastatic OS samples. A PPI network was constructed, and the results indicated that ALB, EGFR, INS, IL6, CDH1, FYN, ERBB2, IL8, CXCL12 and RAC2 were the top 10 core genes. The enrichment analyses of the genes involved in the top three signi\ufb01cant modules demonstrated that the DEGs were principally related to neuroactive ligand\u2011receptor interaction, the Rap1 signaling pathway, and protein digestion and absorption. Together, these data elucidated the molecular mechanisms of OS patients with pulmonary metastasis and provide potential therapeutic targets. However, further experimental studies are needed to confirm these results.\n","623":"\nBackground: As one of the most aggressive malignancies, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(ESCC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer related death worldwide. The majority of ESCCs are diagnosed at advanced stages with poor five-year survival rate, making it urgent to identify specific genes and pathways associated with its initiation and prognosis. Materials and Methods: The differentially expressed genes in TCGA were analysed to construct a co-expression network by WGCNA. Gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis were performed for the selected genes. Module-clinical trait relationships were analyzed to explore the genes and pathways that associated with clinicopathological parameters of ESCC. Log-rank tests and COX regression were used to identify the prognosis-related genes. Results: The brown module containing 716 genes which most significantly contributed to ESCC. GO analysis suggested enrichment of adaptive immune response, cyclin-dependent protein serine, regeneration and mRNA metabolic process. KEGG analysis indicated pathways including Cellular senescence, Ribosome biogenesis, Proteasome, Base excision repair and p53 signaling pathway. Clinical stage was associated with cyan module; clinical M was associated with grey60 module; clinical T was associated with darkturquoise module; while clinical N, histological type and cancer location were associated with turquoise module. Key genes of TCP1, COQ3, PTMA and MAPRE1 might be potential prognostic markers for ESCC. Discussion: Differentially expressed genes and key modules contributing to initiation and progression in ESCC were identified by WGCNA. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the initiation, prognosis and treatment of ESCC.\n\u00a9 The author(s).\n","624":"\nAlthough much progress has been made in the study of cell wall biosynthetic genes in the model filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, there are still targets awaiting characterization. An example is the gene celA (ANIA_08444) encoding a putative mixed linkage glucan synthase. To characterize the role of celA, we deleted it in A. nidulans, analyzed the phenotype of the mycelium and performed RNA-Seq. The strain shows a very strong phenotype, namely \"balloons\" along the hyphae and aberrant conidiophores, as well as an altered susceptibility to cell wall drugs. These data suggest a potential role of the gene in cell wall-related processes. The Gene Ontology term Enrichment analysis shows increased expression of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes (sterigmatocystin in particular) in the deleted strain. Our results show that the deletion of celA triggers a strong phenotype reminiscent of cell wall-related aberrations and the upregulation of some secondary metabolite gene clusters in A. nidulans.\n","625":"\nTrichoderma reesei is a filamentous fungus that is used worldwide to produce industrial enzymes. Industrial strains have traditionally been created though systematic strain improvement using mutagenesis and screening approaches. It is also desirable to specifically manipulate the genes of the organism to further improve and to modify the strain. Targeted integration in filamentous fungi is typically hampered by very low frequencies of homologous recombination. To address this limitation, we have developed a simple transient method for silencing genes in T. reesei Using gene-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted to mus53, we could achieve up to 90% knockdown of mus53 mRNA. As a practical example, we demonstrated that transient silencing of DNA repair genes significantly improved homologous integration of DNA at a specific locus in a standard protoplast transformation. The best transient silencing of mus53 with siRNAs in protoplasts could achieve up to 59% marker gene integration.IMPORTANCE The previous solution for improving targeted integration efficiency has been deleting nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair genes. However, deleting these important repair genes may lead to unintended consequences for genomic stability and could lead to the accumulation of spontaneous mutations. Our method of transiently silencing NHEJ repair pathway genes allows recovery of their important repair functions. Here we report a silencing approach for improving targeted DNA integration in filamentous fungi. Furthermore, our transient silencing method is a truly flexible approach that is capable of knocking down the expression of a target gene in growing mycelial cultures, which could facilitate the broad study of gene functions in T. reesei.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 American Society for Microbiology.\n","626":"\nPlant stem cells are pluripotent cells that have diverse applications in regenerative biology and medicine. However, their roles in plant growth and disease resistance are often overlooked. Using high-throughput RNA-seq data, we identified approximately 20 stem cell-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were responsive to the nitric oxide (NO) donor S-nitrosocysteine (CySNO) after six hours of infiltration. Among these DEGs, the highest number of positive correlations (R \u2265 0.8) was observed for CLAVATA3\/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED (CLE) 12. Gene ontology (GO) terms for molecular function showed DEGs associated with signal transduction and receptor activity. A promoter study of these DEGs showed the presence of cis-acting elements that are involved in growth as well as the regulation of abiotic and biotic stress. Phylogenetic analysis of the Arabidopsis stem cell-related genes and their common orthologs in rice, soybean, poplar, and tomato suggested that most soybean stem cell-related genes were grouped with the Arabidopsis CLE type of stem cell genes, while the rice stem cell-related genes were grouped with the Arabidopsis receptor-like proteins. The functional genomic-based characterization of the role of stem cell DEGs showed that under control conditions, the clv1 mutant showed a similar phenotype to that of the wild-type (WT) plants; however, under CySNO-mediated nitrosative stress, clv1 showed increased shoot and root length compared to WT. Furthermore, the inoculation of clv1 with virulent Pst DC3000 showed a resistant phenotype with fewer pathogens growing at early time points. The qRT-PCR validation and correlation with the RNA-seq data showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of >0.8, indicating the significantly high reliability of the RNA-seq analysis.\n","627":"\nHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) has a major impact on the evolution of prokaryotic genomes, as it allows genes evolved in different contexts to be combined in a single genome, greatly enhancing the ways evolving organisms can explore the gene content space and adapt to the environment. A systematic analysis of HGT in a large number of genomes is of key importance in understanding the impact of HGT in the evolution of prokaryotes. We developed a method for the detection of genes that potentially originated by HGT based on the comparison of BLAST scores between homologous genes to 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic distances between the involved organisms. The approach was applied to 697 prokaryote genomes and estimated that in average approximately 15% of the genes in prokaryote genomes originated by HGT, with a clear correlation between the proportion of predicted HGT genes and the size of the genome. The methodology was strongly supported by evolutionary relationships, as tested by the direct phylogenetic reconstruction of many of the HGT candidates. Studies performed with Escherichia coli W3110 genome clearly show that HGT proteins have fewer interactions when compared to those predicted as vertical inherited, an indication that the number of protein partners imposes limitations to horizontal transfer. A detailed functional classification confirms that genes related to protein translation are vertically inherited, whereas interestingly, transport and binding proteins are strongly enriched among HGT genes. Because these genes are related to the cell exchange with their environment, their transfer most likely contributed to successful adaptation throughout evolution.\n","628":"\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by dramatic neurons loss and axonal regeneration suppression. The underlying mechanism associated with SCI-induced immune suppression is still unclear. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) is now widely applied for the identification of the coexpressed modules, hub genes, and pathways associated with clinic traits of diseases. We performed this study to identify hub genes associated with SCI development. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets GSE45006 and GSE20907 were downloaded and the significant correlativity and connectivity between them were detected using WGCNA. Three significant consensus modules, including 567 eigengenes, were identified from the master GSE45006 data following the preconditions of approximate scale-free topology for WGCNA. Further bioinformatics analysis showed these eigengenes were involved in inflammatory and immune responses in SCI. Three hub genes Rac2, Itgb2, and Tyrobp and one pathway \"natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity\" were identified following short time-series expression miner, protein-protein interaction network, and functional enrichment analysis. Gradually upregulated expression patterns of Rac2, Itgb2, and Tyrobp genes at 0, 3, 7, and 14 days after SCI were confirmed based on GSE45006 and GSE20907 data set. Finally, we found that Rac2, Itgb2, and Tyrobp genes might take crucial roles in SCI development through the \"natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity\" pathway.\n\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","629":"\nThe vertical segments of Populus stems are an ideal experimental system for analyzing the gene expression patterns involved in primary and secondary growth during wood formation. Suitable internal control genes are indispensable to quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays of gene expression. In this study, the expression stability of eight candidate reference genes was evaluated in a series of vertical stem segments of Populus tomentosa. Analysis through software packages geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper showed that genes ribosomal protein (RP) and tubulin beta (TUBB) were the most unstable across the developmental stages of P. tomentosa stems, and the combination of the three reference genes, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), Actin (ACT6) and elongation factor 1-beta (EF1-beta) can provide accurate and reliable normalization of qRT-PCR analysis for target gene expression in stem segments undergoing primary and secondary growth in P. tomentosa. These results provide crucial information for transcriptional analysis in the P. tomentosa stem, which may help to improve the quality of gene expression data in these vertical stem segments, which constitute an excellent plant system for the study of wood formation. \n","630":"\nPapillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most prevalent histological type among thyroid cancers, and some patients are at a high risk for recurrent disease or even death. Identification for the potential biomarkers of PTC may contribute to early discovery of recurrence and treatment. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we obtained the information of RNA sequence data and clinical characteristics of PTC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to construct gene co-expression networks and investigate the relationship between modules and clinical traits. Finally, we constructed 16 co-expression modules in 10,428 genes, and three key modules (darkturquoise, lightyellow, and red) associated with tumor N grade were identified. The results of functional annotation indicated that the darkturquoise module was primarily enriched in the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen metabolism, and cell adhesion, the lightyellow module was primarily enriched in the mitochondrial function regulation and energy synthesis, and the red module was primarily enriched in the process of cell junction, apoptosis, and inflammatory response, suggesting their significant role in the progression of PTC. In addition, the hub genes in the three modules were identified and screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Relapse-free survival analyses found that 11 genes (KCNQ3, MET, FN1, ITGA3, RUNX1, ITGA2, PERP, GCSH, FAAH, NGFRAP1, and HSPA5) may play a pivotal role in PTC relapse. In general, our research revealed the key co-expression modules and identified several prognostic biomarkers, which provides some new insights into the lymph node metastasis of PTC.\n","631":"\nBifidobacteria are mutualistic intestinal bacteria, and their presence in the human gut has been associated with health-promoting activities. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes in this genus is controversial, since, although bifidobacteria are nonpathogenic microorganisms, they could serve as reservoirs of resistance determinants for intestinal pathogens. However, until now, few antibiotic resistance determinants have been functionally characterized in this genus. In this work, we show that Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263 displays atypical resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin. In order to delimit the genomic region responsible for the observed resistance phenotype, a library of genomic DNA was constructed and a fragment of 5.8 kb containing a gene homologous to rRNA methylase genes was able to confer erythromycin resistance in Escherichia coli This genomic region seems to be very uncommon, and homologs of the gene have been detected in only one strain of Bifidobacterium longum and two other strains of B. breve In this context, analysis of shotgun metagenomics data sets revealed that the gene is also uncommon in the microbiomes of adults and infants. The structural gene and its upstream region were cloned into a B. breve-sensitive strain, which became resistant after acquiring the genetic material. In vitro conjugation experiments did not allow us to detect gene transfer to other recipients. Nevertheless, prediction of genes potentially acquired through horizontal gene transfer events revealed that the gene is located in a putative genomic island.IMPORTANCEBifidobacterium breve is a very common human intestinal bacterium. Often described as a pioneer microorganism in the establishment of early-life intestinal microbiota, its presence has been associated with several beneficial effects for the host, including immune stimulation and protection against infections. Therefore, some strains of this species are considered probiotics. In relation to this, because probiotic bacteria are used for human and animal consumption, one of the safety concerns over these bacteria is the presence of antibiotic resistance genes, since the human gut is a densely populated habitat that could favor the transfer of genetic material to potential pathogens. In this study, we analyzed the genetic basis responsible for the erythromycin and clindamycin resistance phenotype of B. breve CECT7263. We were able to identify and characterize a novel gene homologous to rRNA methylase genes which confers erythromycin and clindamycin resistance. This gene seems to be very uncommon in other bifidobacteria and in the gut microbiomes of both adults and infants. Even though conjugation experiments showed the absence of transferability under in vitro conditions, it has been predicted to be located in a putative genomic island recently acquired by specific bifidobacterial strains.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 American Society for Microbiology.\n","632":"\nOryza officinalis Wall ex Watt, a very important and special wild rice species, shows abundant genetic diversity and disease resistance features, especially high resistance to bacterial blight. The molecular mechanisms of bacterial blight resistance in O. officinalis have not yet been elucidated. The WRKY transcription factor family is one of the largest gene families involved in plant growth, development and stress response. However, little is known about the numbers, structure, molecular phylogenetics, and expression of the WRKY genes under Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) stress in O. officinalis due to lacking of O. officinalis genome. Therefore, based on the RNA-sequencing data of O. officinalis, we performed a comprehensive study of WRKY genes in O. officinalis and identified 89 OoWRKY genes. Then 89 OoWRKY genes were classified into three groups based on the WRKY domains and zinc finger motifs. Phylogenetic analysis strongly supported that the evolution of OoWRKY genes were consistent with previous studies of WRKYs, and subgroup IIc OoWRKY genes were the original ancestors of some group II and group III OoWRKYs. Among the 89 OoWRKY genes, eight OoWRKYs displayed significantly different expression (>2-fold, p<0.01) in the O. officinalis transcriptome under Xoo strains PXO99 and C5 stress 48 h, suggesting these genes might play important role in PXO99 and C5 stress responses in O. officinalis. QRT-PCR analysis and confirmation of eight OoWRKYs expression patterns revealed that they responded strongly to PXO99 and C5 stress 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, and the trends of these genes displaying marked changes were consistent with the 48 h RNA-sequencing data, demonstrated these genes played important roles in response to biotic stress and might even involved in the bacterial blight resistance. Tissue expression profiles of eight OoWRKY genes revealed that they were highly expressed in root, stem, leaf, and flower, especially in leaf (except OoWRKY71), suggesting these genes might be also important for plant growth and organ development. In this study, we analyzed the WRKY family of transcription factors in O.officinalis. Insight was gained into the classification, evolution, and function of the OoWRKY genes, revealing the putative roles of eight significantly different expression OoWRKYs in Xoo strains PXO99 and C5 stress responses in O.officinalis. This study provided a better understanding of the evolution and functions of O. officinalis WRKY genes, and suggested that manipulating eight significantly different expression OoWRKYs would enhance resistance to bacterial blight.\n","633":"\nThe antioxidant defense system protects DNA from the damaging effects of oxidative stress and is hypothesized to be associated with an increased risk of male infertility.

The purpose of the present study was to identify the key genes expressed in IAs and provide the basis for further research and treatment. The raw dataset GSE75436 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including 15 IA samples and 15 matched superficial temporal artery (STA) samples. Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package in R software. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on the DEGs using the gplot2 package in R. Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online tools were used to perform gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis. DAVID and gene set enrichment analysis were separately used to perform the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. The intersections of the two results were selected as common KEGG pathways. Protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) analysis among the DEGs involved in the common KEGG pathways was performed using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes online tools, and visualized with Cytoscape software. A total of 782 DEGs were identified, comprising 392 upregulated and 390 downregulated DEGs. Hierarchical clustering demonstrated that the DEGs could precisely distinguish the IAs from the STAs. The GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the upregulated DEGs were mainly involved in the inflammatory response and the management of extracellular matrix, and the downregulated DEGs were mainly involved in the process of vascular smooth muscle contraction. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the common pathways were 'leishmaniasis', 'Toll\u2011like receptor signaling pathway' and 'vascular smooth muscle contraction'. In the PPI network, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 8 and Toll\u2011like receptor 4 had the highest degrees; they were associated with the inflammatory response.

Analysis of relative gene expression by qRT-PCR requires normalization of the data using a reference gene that is expressed at a similar level in all evaluated conditions. Determining an internal control gene is essential for gene expression studies. Gene expression studies in filamentous fungi frequently use the \u03b2-actin gene (actb), \u03b2-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as reference genes because they are known to have consistent expression levels. Until now, no study has been performed to select an internal control gene for the filamentous fungal species Penicillium echinulatum. The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate internal control genes to enable the study of gene expression in P. echinulatum using qRT-PCR. P. echinulatum strain S1M29 was grown in conditions to either induce (cellulose and sugar cane bagasse) or repress (glucose) gene expression to analyze 23 candidate normalization genes for stable expression. Two software programs, BestKeeper and geNorm, were used to assess the expression of the candidate normalization genes. The results indicate that the actb reference gene is more stably expressed in P. echinulatum. This is the first report in the literature that determines a normalization gene for this fungus.

Gene expression chip data for NAFLD and NASH were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between NAFLD and normal controls (called DEGs for NAFLD), as well as between NASH and normal tissue (called DEGs for NASH-Normal), and between NASH and NAFL tissue (called DEGs for NASH-NAFL). For DEGs for the NAFLD group, key genes were identified by studying the form of intersection. Potential functions of DEGs for NASH were then analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. A protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed using the STRING database. A total of 249 DEGs and one key gene for NAFLD were identified. For NASH-Normal, 514 DEGs and 11 hub genes were identified, three of which were closely related to the survival analysis of HCC, and potentially closely related to progression from NASH to HCC. One key gene for NASH-NAFL (AKR1B10) was identified. These genes appear to mediate the molecular mechanism underlying NAFLD and may be promising biomarkers for the presence of NASH.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020.

Nevertheless, the genetic mechanisms of sexual dimorphism and sex determination in E. ulmoides remain poorly understood. In this study de novo transcriptome sequencing on Illumina platform generated >45 billion high-quality bases from fresh leaves of six male and female individuals of E. ulmoides. A total of 148,595 unigenes with an average length of 801 base-pairs (bp) were assembled. Through comparative transcriptome analyses, 116 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the males and the females were detected, including 73 male-biased genes and 43 female-biased genes. Of these DEGs, three female-biased genes were annotated to be related with the sexually dimorphic gutta content in E. ulmoides. One male-biased DEG was identified as putative MADS box gene APETALA3, a B class floral organ identity gene in the flowering plants. SNPs calling analyses further confirmed that the APETALA3-like gene was probably involved in the sex determination in E. ulmoides. Four other male-biased DEGs were potential sex-associated genes as well with segregated SNPs in accord with sex type. In addition, the SNPs density was 1.02 per kilobase (kb) in the expressed genes of E. ulmoides, implying a relatively high genetic diversity.\n","640":"\nAdaptation to chronic hypoxia renders the heart more tolerant to ischemia\/reperfusion injury. To evaluate changes in gene expression after adaptation to chronic hypoxia by RT-qPCR, it is essential to select suitable reference genes. In a chronically hypoxic rat model, no specific reference genes have been identified in the myocardium. This study aimed to select the best reference genes in the left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles of chronically hypoxic and normoxic rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were adapted to continuous normobaric hypoxia (CNH; 12% O2 or 10% O2) for 3\u00a0weeks. The expression levels of candidate genes were assessed by RT-qPCR. The stability of genes was evaluated by NormFinder, geNorm and BestKeeper algorithms. The best five reference genes in the LV were Top1, Nupl2, Rplp1, Ywhaz, Hprt1 for the milder CNH and Top1, Ywhaz, Sdha, Nupl2, Tomm22 for the stronger CNH. In the RV, the top five genes were Hprt1, Nupl2, Gapdh, Top1, Rplp1 for the milder CNH and Tomm22, Gapdh, Hprt1, Nupl2, Top1 for the stronger CNH. This study provides validation of reference genes in LV and RV of CNH rats and shows that suitable reference genes differ in the two ventricles and depend on experimental protocol.\n","641":"\nBoth growth and immune capacity are important traits in animal breeding. The animal quantitative trait loci (QTL) database is a valuable resource and can be used for interpreting the genetic mechanisms that underlie growth and immune traits. However, QTL intervals often involve too many candidate genes to find the true causal genes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide an effective annotation pipeline that can make full use of the information of Gene Ontology terms annotation, linkage gene blocks and pathways to further identify pleiotropic genes and gene sets in the overlapping intervals of growth-related and immunity-related QTLs. In total, 55 non-redundant QTL overlapping intervals were identified, 1893 growth-related genes and 713 immunity-related genes were further classified into overlapping intervals and 405 pleiotropic genes shared by the two gene sets were determined. In addition, 19 pleiotropic gene linkage blocks and 67 pathways related to immunity and growth traits were discovered. A total of 343 growth-related genes and 144 immunity-related genes involved in pleiotropic pathways were also identified, respectively. We also sequenced and genotyped 284 individuals from Chinese Meishan pigs and European pigs and mapped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the pleiotropic genes and gene sets that we identified. A total of 971 high-confidence SNPs were mapped to the pleiotropic genes and gene sets that we identified, and among them 743 SNPs were statistically significant in allele frequency between Meishan and European pigs. This study explores the relationship between growth and immunity traits from the view of QTL overlapping intervals and can be generalized to explore the relationships between other traits. \n","642":"\nEfforts to construct the Streptomyces host strain with enhanced yields of heterologous product have focussed mostly on engineering of primary metabolism and\/or the deletion of endogenous biosynthetic gene clusters. However, other factors, such as chromosome compactization, have been shown to have a significant influence on gene expression levels in bacteria and fungi. The expression of genes and biosynthetic gene clusters may vary significantly depending on their location within the chromosome. Little is known about the position effect in actinomycetes, which are important producers of various industrially relevant bioactive molecules.\nTo demonstrate an impact of the chromosomal position effect on the heterologous expression of genes and gene clusters in Streptomyces albus J1074, a transposon mutant library with randomly distributed transposon that includes a \u03b2-glucuronidase reporter gene was generated. Reporter gene expression levels have been shown to depend on the position on the chromosome. Using a combination of the transposon system and a \u03c6C31-based vector, the aranciamycin biosynthetic cluster was introduced randomly into the S. albus genome. The production levels of aranciamycin varied up to eightfold depending on the location of the gene cluster within the chromosome of S. albus J1074. One of the isolated mutant strains with an artificially introduced attachment site produced approximately 50% more aranciamycin than strains with endogenous attBs.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that expression of the reporter gene and aranciamycin biosynthetic cluster in Streptomyces albus J1074 varies up to eightfold depending on its position on the chromosome. The integration of the heterologous cluster into different locations on the chromosome may significantly influence the titre of the produced substance. This knowledge can be used for the more efficient engineering of Actinobacteria via the relocation of the biosynthetic gene clusters and insertion of additional copies of heterologous constructs in a suitable chromosomal position.\n","643":"\nTagetes erecta is an important commercial plant of Asteraceae family. The male sterile (MS) and male fertile (MF) two-type lines of T. erecta have been utilized in F1 hybrid production for many years, but no report has been made to identify the genes that specify its male sterility that is caused by homeotic conversion of floral organs. In this study, transcriptome assembly and digital gene expression profiling were performed to generate expression profiles of MS and MF plants. A cDNA library was generated from an equal mixture of RNA isolated from MS and MF flower buds (1 mm and 4 mm in diameter). Totally, 87,473,431 clean tags were obtained and assembled into 128,937 transcripts among which 65,857 unigenes were identified with an average length of 1,188 bp. About 52% of unigenes (34,176) were annotated in Nr, Nt, Pfam, KOG\/COG, Swiss-Prot, KO (KEGG Ortholog database) and\/or GO. Taking the above transcriptome as reference, 125 differentially expressed genes were detected in both developmental stages of MS and MF flower buds. MADS-box genes were presumed to be highly related to male sterility in T. erecta based on histological and cytological observations. Twelve MADS-box genes showed significantly different expression levels in flower buds 4 mm in diameter, whereas only one gene expressed significantly different in flower buds 1 mm in diameter between MS and MF plants. This is the first transcriptome analysis in T. erecta and will provide a valuable resource for future genomic studies, especially in flower organ development and\/or differentiation. \n","644":"\nUnderstanding the function of a particular gene under various stresses is important for engineering plants for broad-spectrum stress tolerance. Although virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has been used to characterize genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance, currently available gene silencing and stress imposition methodology at the whole plant level is not suitable for high-throughput functional analyses of genes. This demands a robust and reliable methodology for characterizing genes involved in abiotic and multi-stress tolerance.\nOur methodology employs VIGS-based gene silencing in leaf disks combined with simple stress imposition and effect quantification methodologies for easy and faster characterization of genes involved in abiotic and multi-stress tolerance. By subjecting leaf disks from gene-silenced plants to various abiotic stresses and inoculating silenced plants with various pathogens, we show the involvement of several genes for multi-stress tolerance. In addition, we demonstrate that VIGS can be used to characterize genes involved in thermotolerance. Our results also showed the functional relevance of NtEDS1 in abiotic stress, NbRBX1 and NbCTR1 in oxidative stress; NtRAR1 and NtNPR1 in salinity stress; NbSOS1 and NbHSP101 in biotic stress; and NtEDS1, NbETR1, NbWRKY2 and NbMYC2 in thermotolerance.\nIn addition to widening the application of VIGS, we developed a robust, easy and high-throughput methodology for functional characterization of genes involved in multi-stress tolerance.\n","645":"\nEnvironmental changes, such as nutrient limitation or starvation induce different signal transducing pathways, which require coordinated cooperation of several genes. Our previous data revealed that the fhl1 fork-head type transcription factor of the fission yeast could be involved in sporulation, which was typically induced under poor conditions. Since the exact role of Fhl1 in this process was not known, we wanted to identify its downstream targets and to investigate its possible cooperation with another known regulator of sporulation. Gene expression and Northern blot analysis of the fhl1\u2206 mutant strain revealed the target genes involved in mating and sporulation. Our results also showed that Fhl1 could regulate nutrient sensing, the transporter and permease genes. Since the majority of these genes belonged to the nitrogen starvation response, the possible cooperation of fhl1 and tor2 was also investigated. Comparison of their microarray data and the expression of fhl1 + from a strong promoter in the tor2-ts mutant cells suggested that one part of the target genes are commonly regulated by Fhl1 and Tor2. Since the expression of fhl1 + from a strong promoter could rescue rapamycin and temperature sensitivity and suppressed the hyper-sporulation defect of the tor2-ts mutant cells, we believe that Fhl1 acts in TOR signaling, downstream of Tor2. Thus, this work shed light on certain novel details of the regulation of the sexual processes and a new member of the TOR pathway, but further experiments are needed to confirm the involvement of Fhl1 in nutrient sensing.\n","646":"\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disorder worldwide. To identify more genetic signals, genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been widely used and elucidated some OA susceptibility genes. However, these susceptibility genes could only explain only a small part of heritability of OA. It is suggested that the identification of disease-related pathways may contribute to understand the genomic etiology of OA. Here, we integrated the GWAS into pathway analysis to identify novel OA risk pathways. In this study, we first selected 187 independent genetic variants identified by GWAS (P < 1.00E-05) and found that most of these genetic variants are noncoding mutations. We then conducted an expression quantitative trait loci analysis and found that 165 of these 187 genetic variants could significantly regulate the expression of nearby genes. Third, we identified OA susceptibility genes corresponding to these genetic variants, conducted a pathway analysis, and identified novel OA-related KEGG pathways, GO biological processes, GO molecular functions, and GO cellular components. In KEGG database, transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling pathway is the most significant signal (P = 5.98E-05) and is the only pathway after the BH multiple-test adjustment with false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.02. In GO database, we identified 24 statistically significant GO biological processes, one statistically significant GO molecular function, and five statistically significant GO cellular components (FDR < 0.05). These signals are related with chondrocyte differentiation and development, which are all known biological pathways associated with OA. Finally, we conducted an OA case-control gene expression analysis to evaluate the differential expression of these OA risk genes. Using an OA case-control gene expression analysis, we showed that 44 risk genes were suggestively differentially expressed in OA cases compared with controls (P < 0.05). Three genes, WWP2, COG5, and MAPT, were statistically differentially expressed in OA cases compared with controls (P < 0.05\/122 = 4.10E-04). Hence, our findings may contribute to understanding the genomic etiology of OA.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Gao, Yao, Zhang and Tian.\n","647":"\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria activates pro-inflammatory pathways, dys-regulates the function of endometrial cells and is a key player in the mechanisms involved in endometritis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of LPS on bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEEC) from whole transcriptome with a special focus on genes involved in embryo-maternal interactions. Following in vitro culture, bEEC from three cows were exposed to 0, 2, and 8 \u03bcg\/mL LPS for 24h. RNA samples extracted at 0 and 24 hours were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). At 24h, 2035 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between controls and samples treated with 2 \u03bcg\/mL LPS. Gene ontology analysis showed that over-expressed DEGs were associated to immune response, response to stress and external stimuli, catalytic activity, and cell cycle. Genes associated with cell membrane and cell adhesion pathways were under-expressed. LPS induced changes in expression of specific genes related to embryo-maternal interactions including under-expression of eight members of the cadherin superfamily, over-expression of six members of the mucin family, and differential expression of a large set of genes binding the above molecules and of more than 20 transcripts coding for cytokines and their receptors. Type I interferon-\u03c4 dependent genes were also over-expressed. From a sub-set of 19 genes, (biological replicates of bEEC from cows taken at time 6 (n = 3), 24 (n = 6) and 48 hours (n = 3), and 2 technical replicates per sample) differential gene expression was confirmed by RT2-qPCR (r2 between fold changes at 24 hours by RT2-qPCR and RNA-seq = 0.97). These results indicate that LPS affects the function of bEEC in many ways by differential transcription, glycolytic metabolism and oxidative stress. Many transcriptomic signatures related to implantation and embryo maternal interactions were strongly affected by LPS. These results pave the way for further studies to investigate the duration of these changes and their possible impact on endometrial function and fertility.\n","648":"\nObesity is connected to the activation of chronic inflammatory pathways in both adipocytes and macrophages located in adipose tissues. The nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB is a central molecule involved in inflammatory pathways linked to the pathology of different complex metabolic disorders. Investigating the gene expression data in the adipose tissue would potentially unravel disease relevant gene interactions. The present study is aimed at creating a signature molecular network and at prioritizing the potential biomarkers interacting with NF-\u03baB family of proteins in obesity using system biology approaches. The dataset GSE88837 associated with obesity was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Statistical analysis represented the differential expression of a total of 2650 genes in adipose tissues (p = <0.05). Using concepts like correlation, semantic similarity, and theoretical graph parameters we narrowed down genes to a network of 23 genes strongly connected with NF-\u03baB family with higher significance. Functional enrichment analysis revealed 21 of 23 target genes of NF-\u03baB were found to have a critical role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Interestingly, GEM and PPP1R13L were predicted as novel genes which may act as potential target or biomarkers of obesity as they occur with other 21 target genes with known obesity relationship. Our study concludes that NF-\u03baB and prioritized target genes regulate the inflammation in adipose tissues through several molecular signaling pathways like NF-\u03baB, PI3K-Akt, glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network, angiogenesis and cytokine pathways. This integrated system biology approaches can be applied for elucidating functional protein interaction networks of NF-\u03baB protein family in different complex diseases. Our integrative and network-based approach for finding therapeutic targets in genomic data could accelerate the identification of novel drug targets for obesity.\n","649":"\nThe selection of reference genes in sugarcane under Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) infection has not been reported and is indispensable to get reliable reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results for validation of transcriptome analysis.

Hosts are constantly evolving to suppress virulence and replication, while viruses, which are reliant on host machinery for survival and reproduction, develop counterstrategies to escape this immune defense. Viruses must also adapt to novel conditions while establishing themselves in a host species. Both processes provide strong selection for viral adaptation. Understanding adaptive evolution in insect viruses can help us to better understand adaptive evolution in general and is important due to the use of these viruses as biocontrol agents and for protecting ecologically or economically important species from outbreaks. Here we examine the molecular evolution of baculoviruses and nudiviruses, a group of insect-infecting viruses with key roles in biocontrol. We looked for signatures of selection between genomes of baculoviruses infecting a range of species and within a population of baculoviruses. Both analyses found only a few strong signatures of positive selection, primarily in replication- and transcription-associated genes and several structural protein genes. In both analyses, we detected a conserved complex of genes, including the helicase gene, showing consistently high levels of adaptive evolution, suggesting that they may be key in antagonistic coevolution to escape host suppression. These genes are integral to the baculovirus life cycle and may be good focal genes for developing baculoviruses as effective biocontrol agents or for targeting baculoviruses infecting ecologically relevant species. Recombination and complex genomes make evolution in these double-stranded DNA viruses more efficient than that in smaller RNA viruses with error-prone replication, as seen via signatures of selection in specific genes within a population of baculoviruses.IMPORTANCE Most viral evolutionary studies focus on RNA viruses. While these viruses cause many human and animal diseases, such studies leave us with a lesser understanding of how DNA viruses adapt to hosts and how the host responds to these pathogens. In this paper, we focus on the evolution of baculoviruses, a group of insect-infecting DNA viruses, many of which have been used in biocontrol. We find that most of the genome is under purifying selection, with only a few key genes evolving adaptively. Our results provide a glimpse into how DNA viruses differ from RNA viruses in their evolutionary dynamics and identify genes that are key to DNA virus adaptation, improving our understanding of how this group of pathogens evolves.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Hill and Unckless.\n","651":"\nInteractions between Leptosphaeria maculans, causal agent of stem canker of oilseed rape, and its Brassica hosts are models of choice to explore the multiplicity of 'gene-for-gene' complementarities and how they diversified to increased complexity in the course of plant-pathogen co-evolution. Here, we support this postulate by investigating the AvrLm10 avirulence that induces a resistance response when recognized by the Brassica nigra resistance gene Rlm10. Using genome-assisted map-based cloning, we identified and cloned two AvrLm10 candidates as two genes in opposite transcriptional orientation located in a subtelomeric repeat-rich region of the genome. The AvrLm10 genes encode small secreted proteins and show expression profiles in planta similar to those of all L.\u00a0maculans avirulence genes identified so far. Complementation and silencing assays indicated that both genes are necessary to trigger Rlm10 resistance. Three assays for protein-protein interactions showed that the two AvrLm10 proteins interact physically in\u00a0vitro and in planta. Some avirulence genes are recognized by two distinct resistance genes and some avirulence genes hide the recognition specificities of another. Our L.\u00a0maculans model illustrates an additional case where two genes located in opposite transcriptional orientation are necessary to induce resistance. Interestingly, orthologues exist for both L.\u00a0maculans genes in other phytopathogenic species, with a similar genome organization, which may point to an important conserved effector function linked to heterodimerization of the two proteins.\n\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Microarray data GSE33429, including array-based comparative genomic hybridization and gene expression profiles, were obtained. DEGs were screened between GC and adjacent noncancerous tissues. Genes located at Minimum Common Regions (MCRs) were identified, and overlapped genes between DEGs and genes with amplification or deletion were identified. Gene Ontology function and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed. A protein-protein interaction network for DEGs was built, and significant modules were mined from the network. Functional annotation of genes in modules was also performed. A total of 677 up- and 583 downregulated DEGs were identified, including 37 overexpressed genes located at gained MCRs and 28 downregulated genes located at deleted MCRs. In significant modules, upregulated genes with amplification, including DSN1 (MIS12 kinetochore complex component), MAPRE1 (microtubule-associated protein, RP\/EB family, member 1), TPX2 (microtubule-associated), UBE2C (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C), and MYBL2 (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog-like 2), were associated with cell cycle, but downregulated genes with deletion, including UGT2B15 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, polypeptide B15), UGT2B17 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, polypeptide B17), ADH1B (alcohol dehydrogenase 1B), and ADH1A (alcohol dehydrogenase 1A), were related to metabolism. The identified genes DSN1, MAPRE1, TPX2, UBE2C, and MYBL2 located at gained MCRs and UGT2B15, UGT2B17, ADH1B, and ADH1A located at deleted MCRs may play an important role in GC progression through regulating cell cycle and metabolism.\n","653":"\nWe previously identified the aur1 gene cluster which produces the angucycline antibiotic auricin. Preliminary characterisation of auricin revealed that it is modified by a single aminodeoxysugar, D-forosamine. Here we characterise the D-forosamine-specific genes. The four close tandem genes, aur1TQSV, encoding enzymes involved in the initial steps of the deoxysugar biosynthesis, were located on a large operon with other core auricin biosynthetic genes. Deleting these genes resulted in the absence of auricin and the production of deglycosylated auricin intermediates. The two final D-forosamine biosynthetic genes, sa59, an NDP-hexose aminotransferase, and sa52, an NDP-aminohexose N-dimethyltransferase, are located in a region rather distant from the core auricin genes. A deletion analysis of these genes confirmed their role in D-forosamine biosynthesis. The \u0394sa59 mutant had a phenotype similar to that of the cluster deletion mutant, while the \u0394sa52 mutant produced an auricin with a demethylated D-forosamine. Although auricin contains a single deoxyhexose, two glycosyltransferase genes were found to participate in the attachment of D-forosamine to the auricin aglycon. An analysis of the expression of the D-forosamine biosynthesis genes revealed that the initial D-forosamine biosynthetic genes aur1TQSV are regulated together with the other auricin core genes by the aur1Ap promoter under the control of the auricin-specific activator Aur1P. The expression of the other D-forosamine genes, however, is governed by promoters differentially dependent upon the two SARP family auricin-specific activators Aur1PR3 and Aur1PR4. These promoters contain direct repeats similar to the SARP consensus sequence and are involved in the interaction with both regulators. \n","654":"\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a reliable tool for gene expression analysis in various organisms. Its use in aquaculture and study of fish physiology is increasing day by day. Relative quantification of mRNA through real-time qPCR requires suitable housekeeping genes\/reference genes.

In light of the literature reviewed here, it is clear that expression of most of the genes varied in different physiological conditions, under different experimental conditions, and in different gender. Use of housekeeping genes without proper validation may lead to erroneous results and misinterpretation of data. To solve this problem, various types of user-friendly software are now available for validation of housekeeping genes. Moreover, it is recommended to use more than one housekeeping gene for relative quantification. Using the geometric mean of the three most stable genes as a housekeeping gene can also solve this problem to some extent.

Salmonella Enteritidis colonizes the gastro-intestinal tract of chickens and replicates within macrophages without causing clinically discernable illness. Persistence of S. Enteritidis in the hostile environments of intestinal tract and macrophages allows it to disseminate extra-intestinally to liver, spleen, and reproductive tract. Extra-intestinal dissemination into reproductive tract leads to contamination of internal contents of eggs, which is a major risk factor for human infection. Understanding the genes that contribute to S. Enteritidis persistence in the chicken host is central to elucidate the genetic basis of the unique pathobiology of this public health pathogen. The aim of this study was to identify a succinct set of genes associated with infection-relevant in vitro environments to provide a rational foundation for subsequent biologically-relevant research. We used in silico prediction of gene expression and RNA-seq technology to identify a core set of 73 S. Enteritidis genes that are consistently highly expressed in multiple S. Enteritidis strains cultured at avian physiologic temperature under conditions that represent intestinal and intracellular environments. These common highly expressed (CHX) genes encode proteins involved in bacterial metabolism, protein synthesis, cell-envelope biogenesis, stress response, and a few proteins with uncharacterized functions. Further studies are needed to dissect the contribution of these CHX genes to the pathobiology of S. Enteritidis in the avian host. Several of the CHX genes could serve as promising targets for studies towards the development of immunoprophylactic and novel therapeutic strategies to prevent colonization of chickens and their environment with S.

SL trans-splicing occurs in several animal taxa, including bdelloid rotifers (Rotifera, Bdelloidea). One striking feature of these aquatic microinvertebrates is the large proportion of foreign genes, i.e. those acquired by horizontal gene transfer from other organisms, in their genomes. However, whether such foreign genes behave similarly to native genes has not been tested in bdelloids or any other animal. We therefore used a combination of experimental and computational methods to examine whether transcripts of foreign genes in bdelloids were SL trans-spliced, like their native counterparts. We found that many foreign transcripts contain SLs, use similar splice acceptor sequences to native genes, and are able to undergo alternative trans-splicing. However, a significantly lower proportion of foreign mRNAs contains SL sequences than native transcripts. This demonstrates a novel functional difference between foreign and native genes in bdelloids and suggests that SL trans-splicing is not essential for the expression of foreign genes, but is acquired during their domestication. \nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Selected GRAS genes were introduced into Escherichia coli to express proteins.\nBased on phylogenetic relationship with the Arabidopsis and Oryza GRAS family members, 47 GRAS genes from D. catenatum are identified and their deduced proteins are classified into 11 subgroups. Most of these GRAS genes contain one exon and closely related members in the phylogenetic tree have similar motif composition. Our result also reveals that GRAS genes in D. catenatum are widely distributed and expressed in different tissue. In addition, 35 GRAS genes are successfully cloned from different subgroups and 7 DoGRAS fusion proteins are induced using E. coli system.

Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has become the \"gold standard\" to gain insight into function of genes. However, the accuracy of the technique depends on appropriate reference genes for quantification analysis in different experimental conditions. Accumulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has also been studied by RT-qPCR, but there are no reference genes currently validated for normalization of Brassica napus miRNA expression data. In this study, we selected 43 B. napus miRNAs and 18 previously validated mRNA reference genes. The expression stability of the candidate reference genes was evaluated in different tissue samples (stages of seed development, flowers, and leaves) using geNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder analysis. The best-ranked reference genes for expression studies during seed development (miR167-1_2, miR11-1, miR159-1 and miR168-1) were used to asses the expression of miR03-1. Since candidate miRNAs showed higher expression stability than protein-coding genes in most of the tested conditions, the expression profile of DGAT1 gene was compared when normalized by the four most stable miRNAs reference genes and by the four most stable mRNA reference genes. The expected expression pattern of DGAT1 during seed development was achieved with the use of miRNA as reference genes. In conclusion, the most stable miRNA reference genes can be employed in the normalization of RT-qPCR quantification of miRNAs and protein-coding genes. This work is the first to perform a comprehensive survey of the stability of miRNA reference genes in B. napus and provides guidelines to obtain more accurate RT-qPCR results in B. napus seeds studies.\n","659":"\nThere is growing evidence that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be important players in the tumor microenvironment.

Considering that we were not able to find a reference gene originated by an appropriate validation, in this study we evaluated candidate genes to be used as reference gene in C6 cells under different treatments with adipose-derived stem cells conditioned medium (CM-ADSCs). \u03b2-actin (ACTB); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase I (HPRT-1); TATA box binding protein (TBP) and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were evaluated by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). The mean Cq, the maximum fold change (MFC) and NormFinder software were used for reference gene evaluation and selection.\nThe GAPDH and ACTB genes have been the most widely used reference genes to normalize among the different investigated genes in our review, however, controversially these genes underwent a substantial variability among the genes evaluated in the present work. Individually, TBP gene was more stable when compared with other genes analyzed and the combination of TBP and HPRT-1 was even more stable.\nThese results evidence the importance of appropriate validation of reference genes before performing qPCR experiments. Besides, our data will contribute with researchers that work analyzing the role of ADSCs in glioma microenvironment through gene expression.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Power to identify causal variants in these groups beyond a statistical significance threshold is challenging due to small sample size and\/or lack of family information. There is a need to develop novel methods to identify NS-associated variants. One way to determine putative functional relevance of a gene is to measure its strength of negative selection, as variants in genes under strong negative selection are more likely to be deleterious. We created a gene-level, integrated metric of negative selection (GIMS) score for 20,079 genes by combining multiple comparative genomics and population genetics measures. To understand the utility of GIMS for NS gene discovery, we examined this score in a diverse set of NS-relevant gene sets. These included genes known to cause monogenic forms of NS in humans as well as genes expressed in the cells of the glomerulus and, particularly, the podocyte. We found strong negative selection in the following NS-relevant gene sets: (1) autosomal-dominant Mendelian focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) genes (p = 0.03 compared to reference), (2) glomerular expressed genes (p = 4\u00d710(-23)), and (3) predicted podocyte genes (p = 3\u00d710(-9)). Eight genes causing autosomal dominant forms of FSGS had a stronger combined score of negative selection and podocyte enrichment as compared to all other genes (p = 1 x 10(-3)). As a whole, recessive FSGS genes were not enriched for negative selection. Thus, we also created a transcript-level, integrated metric of negative selection (TIMS) to quantify negative selection on an isoform level. These revealed transcripts of known autosomal recessive disease-causing genes that were nonetheless under strong selection. We suggest that a filtering strategy that includes measuring negative selection on a gene or isoform level could aid in identifying NS-related genes. Our GIMS and TIMS scores are available at http:\/\/glom.sph.umich.edu\/GIMS\/.\n","661":"\nTo enhance our knowledge regarding biological pathway regulation, we took an integrated approach, using the biomedical literature, ontologies, network analyses and experimental investigation to infer novel genes that could modulate biological pathways. We first constructed a novel gene network via a pairwise comparison of all yeast genes' Ontology Fingerprints--a set of Gene Ontology terms overrepresented in the PubMed abstracts linked to a gene along with those terms' corresponding enrichment P-values. The network was further refined using a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify novel genes that could potentially influence the pathway activities. We applied this method to the sphingolipid pathway in yeast and found that many top-ranked genes indeed displayed altered sphingolipid pathway functions, initially measured by their sensitivity to myriocin, an inhibitor of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. Further experiments confirmed the modulation of the sphingolipid pathway by one of these genes, PFA4, encoding a palmitoyl transferase. Comparative analysis showed that few of these novel genes could be discovered by other existing methods. Our novel gene network provides a unique and comprehensive resource to study pathway modulations and systems biology in general.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.

However, these genes have not been extensively studied in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a model for Solanaceae plants and for fleshy fruit development. Here, we identified and systematically analyzed 38 CesA\/Csl family members that contained cellulose synthase domain regions, and categorized their encoded proteins into 6 subfamilies (CesA, CslA, CslB, CslD, CslE, and CslG) based on phylogenetic analysis. Most CesA\/Csl genes from tomato are closely related to those from Arabidopsis, but the families have distinct features regarding gene structure, chromosome distribution and localization, phylogeny, and deduced protein sequence, indicating that they arose via different evolutionary process. Furthermore, expression analysis of CesA\/Csl genes in different tissues at various developmental stages showed that most CesAs were constitutively expressed with differential expression levels in various organs; three CslD genes were expressed specifically in flowers, and four CesA and five Csl putative genes were preferentially expressed in fruits. Our results provide insight into the general characteristics of the CesA\/Csl genes in tomato, and lay the foundation for further functional studies of CesA\/Csl genes in tomato and other Solanaceae species.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018.

However, when heterologously expressed, genes in the same operon are usually not equally expressed, and the ratio needs to be fine-tuned. A gene cluster of three genes (corresponding to \u03b1-subunit, \u03b2-subunit and activator) encoding the nitrile hydratase was cloned from Aurantimonas manganoxydans ATCC BAA-1229 and expressed in Escherichia coli. However, difficulty was encountered in heterologous expression of the activator and the expression level of \u03b2-subunit was lower than that of \u03b1-subunit, which together resulted in low catalytic efficiency. To improve the expression of activator, a set of SKIK tags were fused to the N-terminus of the activator. To elevate the expression level of \u03b2-subunit, a silent mutation strategy was applied in the overlapping sequence with \u03b1-subunit around its translation initial region. Finally, the expression of \u03b2-subunit and activator were improved and the maximum activity of NHase1229 was doubled, reaching 160\u202fU\/mL towards 3-cyanopyridine. These results indicate that N-terminal engineering is an efficient strategy for optimizing the expression of multiple genes in operons.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanism of recurrence is still unclear, and it is urgent to clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of bladder cancer. To provide theoretical basis for the development of new therapies, investigating the effect of tumor microenvironment on the prognosis of bladder cancer is necessary. Methods: We applied the Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumors using Expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm to the downloaded TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) transcriptome data to obtain the immune scores and stromal scores of each sample, and then divided the samples into two groups: high and low immune scores (or high and low stromal scores), and found that some differential genes were associated with poor prognosis of patients. We then performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to explore the relationship between these differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we also performed (Gene Ontology) GO and (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) KEGG analyses to explore the potential functions of differentially expressed genes. Finally, our results were validated in an independent dataset. Results: We identified 136 tumor microenvironment-related genes associated with poor prognosis of bladder cancer. GO annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis found that these genes are mainly involved in extracellular matrix, Focal adhesion and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinaseB (PI3k-Akt) signaling pathway. Next, PPI network analysis revealed some hub genes including Versican (VCAN), Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) and Thrombospondin 1 (THBS2). Finally, 27 genes were further verified in the independent data set. Conclusions: We found 27 tumor microenvironment-related genes of bladder cancer, which are associated with poor prognosis of bladder cancer. These genes may inspire researchers to develop new treatments for bladder cancer.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Luo, Zeng and Wu.\n","665":"\nIn this work the complete chloroplast DNAs of Allium paradoxum and Allium ursinum, two edible species of Allium subg. Amerallium (the first lineage), were sequenced, assembled, annotated, and compared with complete Allium plastomes of the second and third evolutionary lines from GenBank database. The A. ursinum plastome contains 90 predicted genes (81 unique) including 5 pseudogenes, while A. paradoxum has 88 predicted genes (79 unique) including 19 pseudogenes. The comparative analysis has revealed that the A. paradoxum plastome differs markedly from those of other species. Due to many deletions, the A. paradoxum plastome is the shortest of known for Allium species, being only 145,819\u202fbp long. The most prominent distinctions are (1) a 4825\u202fbp long local inversion that spans from the ndhE to the rpl32 gene in the small single copy region and (2) pseudogenization, or the loss of all NADH-genes. In contrast, the plastome of A. ursinum - a species from the first evolutionary line (as well as A. paradoxum) - resembles the Allium species of the second and third evolutionary lines, showing no large rearrangements or discrepancies in gene content. It is unclear yet whether only A. paradoxum was affected by some evolutionary events or its close relatives from both sect. Briseis and other sections of Amerallium were altered as well. We speculate the sunlight-intolerant, shade-loving nature of A. paradoxum and the impairment of the ndh genes in its plastome could be interrelated phenomena.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019.

We propose a framework to detect novel genes and networks for predicting breast cancer recurrence. Thirty-four prognosis candidate genes were selected based on a literature review. Four Gene Expression Omnibus Series (GSE) microarray datasets (n\u2009=\u2009920) were used to create gene co-expression networks based on these candidates. We applied the framework to four comparison groups according to node (+\/-) and recurrence (+\/-). We identified a sub-network containing two candidate genes (LST1 and IGHM) and six novel genes (IGHA1, IGHD, IGHG1, IGHG3, IGLC2, and IGLJ3) related to B cell-specific immunoglobulin. These novel genes were correlated with recurrence under the control of node status and were found to function as tumor suppressors; higher mRNA expression indicated a lower risk of recurrence (hazard ratio, HR\u2009=\u20090.87, p\u2009=\u20090.001). We created an immune index score by performing principle component analysis and divided the genes into low and high groups. This discrete index significantly predicted relapse-free survival (RFS) (high: HR\u2009=\u20090.77, p\u2009=\u20090.019; low: control). Public tool KM Plotter and TCGA-BRCA gene expression data were used to validate.

It was found that the mutation frequency of the Nebulin gene (NEB) at amino acid 1133 locus of thyroid cancer patients was much higher than that of the normal population, suggesting that NEB mutation may be related to thyroid cancer. Therefore, we constructed the NEB mutant mice for further investigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The RNA extracted from the thyroid of wild-type and NEB mutant mice was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, and the differential expression was analyzed by edgeR software. Several differentially expressed genes were selected for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) verification, and these genes were analyzed with Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. RESULTS A total of 624 genes were significantly enriched. Analysis of GO function and pathway significant enrichment showed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in thyroid cancer, myocardial contraction, and autoimmune thyroid disease. The qRT-PCR results were consistent with the high-throughput sequencing results. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that the expression of some cancer-driving genes and cancer suppressor genes are significantly changed in NEB mutant mice compared to wild-type mice, which suggests that NEB function plays an important role in regulating the expression of cancer-related genes in the thyroid gland.\n","668":"\nHow genes are repressed by steroid hormones remains a matter of debate, and several indirect mechanisms have been proposed. We found that the ligand-activated progesterone receptor recruits to the promoter of downregulated genes a repressor complex composed of HP1\u03b3, the lysine demethylase LSD1, histone deacetylases, coREST, the RNA SRA, and the ATPase BRG1. BRG1 is needed for chromatin remodeling and facilitates the deposition of linker histone variant H1.2, which compacts chromatin and hinders RNA polymerase loading and transcription. Thus, steroid hormone receptors can repress genes in ways reminiscent of those used for gene induction, namely by directly targeting factors that remodel chromatin. But while PR-dependent gene induction in T47D cells is mainly achieved by potentiating enhancer activity, repression acts at the level of gene promoters.\n","669":"\nOn the basis of the concept of biological activity, the large-scale evolution by generating new genes from gene duplication is theoretically compared between the monoploid organism and the diploid organism. The comparison is carried out not only for the process of generating one new gene but also for the process of generating two or more kinds of new genes from successive gene duplication. This comparison reveals the following difference in evolutionary pattern between the monoploids and diploids. The monoploid organism is more suitable to generate one or two new genes step by step but its successive gene duplication is obliged to generate smaller sizes of genes by the severer lowering of biological activity or self-reproducing rate. This is consistent with the evolutionary pattern of prokaryotes having steadily developed chemical syntheses, O\u2082-releasing photosynthesis and O\u2082-respiration in the respective lineages. On the other hand, the diploid organism with the plural number of homologous chromosome pairs has a chance to get together many kinds of new genes by the hybridization of variants having experienced different origins of gene duplication. Although this strategy of hybridization avoids the severe lowering of biological activity, it takes the longer time to establish the homozygotes of the more kinds of new genes. During this long period, furthermore different types of variants are accumulated in the population, and their successive hybridization sometimes yields various styles of new organisms. This evolutionary pattern explains the explosive divergence of body plans that has occasionally occurred in the diploid organisms, because the cell differentiation is a representative character exhibited by many kinds of genes and its evolution to the higher hierarchy constructs body plans.\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we used an excess of significant markers (ESM) test to study gene-level associations in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) SNP data from a family-based sample, having medically severe suicide attempt (SA) as main outcome in the offspring. In SA without major psychiatric disorders (N\u2009=\u2009498), a screening of 5,316 genes across the genome suggested association 17 genes (at fdr\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes RETREG1 (a.k.a.

If some of these genes survive across speciations, then extant organisms will contain a patchwork of genes whose ancestors first appeared at different times. Standard phylostratigraphy, the technique of partitioning genes by their age, is based solely on protein similarity algorithms. However, this approach relies on negative evidence \u2500 a failure to detect a homolog of a query gene. An alternative approach is to limit the search for homologs to syntenic regions. Then, genes can be positively identified as de novo orphans by tracing them to non-coding sequences in related species.\nWe have developed a synteny-based pipeline in the R framework. Fagin determines the genomic context of each query gene in a focal species compared to homologous sequence in target species. We tested the fagin pipeline on two focal species, Arabidopsis thaliana (plus four target species in Brassicaseae) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (plus six target species in Saccharomyces). Using microsynteny maps, fagin classified the homology relationship of each query gene against each target genome into three main classes, and further subclasses: AAic (has a coding syntenic homolog), NTic (has a non-coding syntenic homolog), and Unknown (has no detected syntenic homolog). fagin inferred over half the \"Unknown\" A. thaliana query genes, and about 20% for S. cerevisiae, as lacking a syntenic homolog because of local indels or scrambled synteny.\nfagin augments standard phylostratigraphy, and extends synteny-based phylostratigraphy with an automated, customizable, and detailed contextual analysis. By comparing synteny-based phylostrata to standard phylostrata, fagin systematically identifies those orphans and lineage-specific genes that are well-supported to have originated de novo. Analyzing within-species genomes should distinguish orphan genes that may have originated through rapid divergence from de novo orphans. Fagin also delineates whether a gene has no syntenic homolog because of technical or biological reasons. These analyses indicate that some orphans may be associated with regions of high genomic perturbation.\n","672":"\nPeucedanum praeruptorum Dunn is one of the main traditional Chinese medicines producing coumarins and plenty of literatures are focused on the biosynthesis of coumarins. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is a widely used method in studying the biosynthesis pathway and the selection of reference genes plays a crucial role in accurate normalization. To facilitate biosynthesis study of coumarins, twelve candidate reference genes were selected from the transcriptome database of P. praeruptorum according to previous studies. Then, BestKeeper, geNoFrm and NormFinder were used for selecting stably expressed reference genes in different tissues and under various stress treatments. The results indicated that, among the twelve candidate reference genes, the SAND family protein (SAND), actin 2 (ACT2), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9), protein phosphatase 2A gene (PP2A) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) were the most stable reference genes under different experimental treatments, while glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tubulin beta-6 (TUB6) were the least stable genes. In addition, the suitability of SAND, TIP41-like protein (TIP41), UBC9, ACT2, TUB6 and their combination as reference genes were confirmed by normalizing the expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) in different treatments.

Using a molecular biological technique to mine sugarcane resistance genes can provide gene resources for further genetic engineering of sugarcane disease-resistant breeding. Jasmonate ZIM (zinc-finger inflorescence meristem) domain (JAZ) proteins, which involved in the responses to plant pathogens and abiotic stresses, are important signaling molecules of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway.\nSeven differentially expressed sugarcane JAZ genes, ScJAZ1-ScJAZ7, were mined from the transcriptome of sugarcane after inoculation with S. scitamineum. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that these seven ScJAZ genes encoded basic proteins that contain the TIFY and CCT_2 domains. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that the ScJAZ1-ScJAZ7 genes were tissue specific and differentially expressed under adverse stress. During S. scitamineum infection, the transcripts of ScJAZ4 and ScJAZ5 were both upregulated in the susceptible genotype ROC22 and the resistant genotype Yacheng05-179; ScJAZ1, ScJAZ2, ScJAZ3, and ScJAZ7 were downregulated in Yacheng05-179 and upregulated in ROC22; and the expression of ScJAZ6 did not change in ROC22, but was upregulated in Yacheng05-179. The transcripts of the seven ScJAZ genes were increased by the stimuli of salicylic acid and abscisic acid, particularly methyl jasmonate. The expression of the genes ScJAZ1-ScJAZ7 was immediately upregulated by the stressors hydrogen peroxide, sodium chloride, and copper chloride, whereas slightly induced after treatment with calcium chloride and polyethylene glycol. In addition, the expression of ScJAZ6, as well as seven tobacco immunity-associated marker genes were upregulated, and antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas solanacearum and Fusarium solani var. coeruleum was observed during the transient overexpression of ScJAZ6 in Nicotiana benthamiana, suggesting that the ScJAZ6 gene is associated with plant immunity.\nThe different expression profiles of the ScJAZ1-ScJAZ7 genes during S. scitamineum infection, the positive response of ScJAZ1-ScJAZ7 to hormones and abiotic treatments, and the function analysis of the ScJAZ6 gene revealed their involvement in the defense against biotic and abiotic stresses.

They are found in many organisms from fungi to humans. The myosin gene family in Bombyx mori is poorly studied, even though the molecular functions of these genes in vertebrates and insects, such as Drosophila, are well known. We identified 16 myosin genes from B. mori and identified the myosin genes in 12 vertebrates, eight insects, three nematodes, and seven protozoa. The number of myosin genes in vertebrates is double the number in invertebrates. The number of myosin isoforms in classes I and II is larger in vertebrates compared to invertebrates. B. mori myosin genes can be classified into 11 classes. Compared to B. mori, some myosin classes are not present in other insects. Classes I, II, XVIII, and XXI appear to be important for insect survival because they are conserved among nine insects. The relatively large sizes of B. mori myosin genes are due to their longer introns. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that many B. mori myosin genes have tissue-specific expression and exhibit temporal-specific activity during metamorphosis. These data provide insights into evolutionary and functional aspects of B. mori myosin genes that could be useful for the study of homologous myosins in other Lepidoptera species.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

About 46.3 million clean pair end (PE) reads were generated and assembled into 40,826 unigenes with a mean length of 830 bp. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed on both the control roots (CK) and P. coffeae-challenged roots (CH), and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Approximately 10.16 and 8.07 million cDNA reads in the CK and CH cDNA libraries were sequenced, respectively. A total of 137 genes exhibited different transcript abundances between the two libraries. Among them, the expressions of 117 and 20 DEGs were up- and down-regulated in P. coffeae-challenged ramie, respectively. The expression patterns of 15 candidate genes determined by qRT-PCR confirmed the results of DGE analysis. Time-course expression profiles of eight defense-related genes in susceptible and resistant ramie cultivars were different after P. coffeae inoculation. The differential expression of protease inhibitors, pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs), and transcription factors in resistant and susceptible ramie during P. coffeae infection indicated that cystatin likely plays an important role in nematode resistance.\n","676":"\nMelanoma is one of the most malignant types of skin cancer. However, the efficacy and utility of available drug therapies for melanoma are limited. The objective of the present study was to identify potential genes associated with melanoma progression and to explore approved therapeutic drugs that target these genes.

Gene expression profiles of the GSE65904 dataset were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. RNA-sequencing data and clinical information associated with melanoma obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas were used for biomarker validation. A total of 15 modules were identified through average linkage hierarchical clustering. In the two significant modules, three network hub genes associated with melanoma prognosis were identified: C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit \u03b3 (PIK3CG). The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the mRNA levels of these genes exhibited excellent prognostic efficiency for primary and metastatic tumor tissues. In addition, the proximity between candidate genes associated with melanoma progression and drug targets obtained from DrugBank was calculated in the protein interaction network, and the top 15 drugs that may be suitable for treating melanoma were identified. In summary, co-expression network analysis led to the selection of CXCR4, IL7R and PIK3CG for further basic and clinical research on melanoma.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms of this disease are poorly known. Based on gene sequencing data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we constructed coexpression networks by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). The core gene of pathogenesis, CRSwNP, was screened by protein-protein interaction data (PPI) from the HPRD database. Unsupervised clustering was applied to screen hub genes related to the phenotype of CRSwNP. Blue and turquoise modules were found to be most significantly related to the pathogenicity of CRSwNP. Functional enrichment analysis showed that cell proliferation in the blue modules, the apoptotic process in the turquoise module, and the cancer pathway in both modules were mostly significantly correlated with the development of CRSwNP. The noncoding RNAs (long noncoding RNA and microRNA) and the top 10 core genes in each module were found to be associated with the pathogenesis of CRSwNP. A total of nine hub genes were identified to be related to the CRSwNP phenotype. By qRT-PCR analysis, AKT1, CDH1, PIK3R1, CBL, LRP1, MALAT1, and XIST were proven to be associated with the pathogenesis of CRSwNP. AGR2, FAM3D, PIP, DSE, and TMC were identified to be related to the CRSwNP phenotype.

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, RANTES, and TNF-\u03b1 gene expression in the rectal tissue. The intra-assay, inter-biopsy and inter-subject variance was measured in the eight participants. Bootstrap re-sampling of the biopsy measurements was performed to determine the accuracy of gene expression data obtained for 10 biopsies obtained from one participant. Cytokines were both non-normalized and normalized using four reference genes (GAPDH, \u03b2-actin, \u03b22 microglobulin, and CD45).\nCytokine measurement accuracy was increased with the number of biopsy samples, per person; four biopsies were typically needed to produce a mean result within a 95% confidence interval of the subject's cytokine level approximately 80% of the time. Intra-assay precision (% geometric standard deviation) ranged between 8.2 and 96.9 with high variance between patients and even between different biopsies from the same patient. Variability was not greatly reduced with the use of reference genes to normalize data.\nThe number of biopsy samples required to provide an accurate result varied by target although 4 biopsy samples per subject and timepoint, provided for >77% accuracy across all targets tested. Biopsies within the same subjects and between subjects had similar levels of variance while variance within a biopsy (intra-assay) was generally lower. Normalization of inflammatory cytokines against reference genes failed to consistently reduce variance. The accuracy and reliability of mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines will set a ceiling on the ability of these measures to predict mucosal inflammation. Techniques to reduce variability should be developed within a larger cohort of individuals before normative reference values can be validated.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, deriving a disease related inference from a list of differentially expressed genes has proven less than straightforward. In a systems disease such as cancer, how genes interact with each other should matter just as much as the level of gene expression. Here, in a novel approach, we used the network and disease progression properties of individual genes in state-specific gene-gene interaction networks (GGINs) to select cancer genes for human colorectal cancer (CRC) and obtain a much higher hit rate of known cancer genes when compared with methods not based on network theory. We constructed GGINs by integrating gene expression microarray data from multiple states--healthy control (Nor), adenoma (Ade), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and CRC--with protein-protein interaction database and Gene Ontology. We tracked changes in the network degrees and clustering coefficients of individual genes in the GGINs as the disease state changed from one to another. From these we inferred the state sequences Nor-Ade-CRC and Nor-IBD-CRC both exhibited a trend of (disease) progression (ToP) toward CRC, and devised a ToP procedure for selecting cancer genes for CRC. Of the 141 candidates selected using ToP, \u223c50% had literature support as cancer genes, compared to hit rates of 20% to 30% for standard methods using only gene expression data. Among the 16 candidate cancer genes that encoded transcription factors, 13 were known to be tumorigenic and three were novel: CDK1, SNRPF, and ILF2. We identified 13 of the 141 predicted cancer genes as candidate markers for early detection of CRC, 11 and 2 at the Ade and IBD states, respectively.\n","681":"\nFSP27 KO mice showed enhanced expression of mitochondrial genes, increased mitochondrial activity and smaller lipid droplets. Here, we aimed to investigate lipid droplet protein (CIDEC\/FSP27 and perilipinA (PLIN1)) gene expression in human adipose tissue in association with obesity, insulin resistance and mitochondrial gene expression.\nIn cohort 1, CIDEC\/FSP27, PLIN1, adipogenic (FASN, ACACA, PPARG, GLUT4) and mitochondrial (PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, TFAM, MT-CO3) gene expression were analyzed in 171 adipose tissue samples (88 visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and 83 subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) depots) and in a time course experiment in human subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes using real-time PCR. In cohort 2, the effects of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss were also evaluated in six caucasian morbidly obese women. Additionally, in cohort 2 FSP27 and PLIN1 protein levels were measured using western blotting.\nCIDEC\/FSP27 (1.03\u00b10.52 vs 0.49\u00b10.23 relative gene expression unit (R.U.), P<0.0001) and PLIN1 (1.32\u00b10.82 vs 0.63\u00b10.42 R.U., P<0.0001) gene were significantly more expressed in SAT than in VAT. In VAT, CIDEC\/FSP27 and PLIN1 gene expression decreased with body mass index, percent fat mass, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA and were positively associated with adipogenic (PPARG, GLUT4, FASN and ACACA) and mitochondrial biogenesis (PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, TFAM and MT-CO3)-related genes. Mitochondrial gene expression increased during adipocyte differentiation in parallel to FSP27 and PLIN1 and other adipogenic genes. After bariatric surgery-induced weight loss, PLIN1 and CIDEC\/FSP27 gene and protein expression in SAT increased significantly in parallel to adipogenic and mitochondrial genes.\nThese findings suggest a positive functional interaction between CIDEC\/FSP27, PLIN1 and mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes in human adipose tissue.\n","682":"\nDetermining which reference genes have the highest stability, and are therefore appropriate for normalising data, is a crucial step in the design of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) gene expression studies. This is particularly warranted in non-model and ecologically important species for which appropriate reference genes are lacking, such as the mallard--a key reservoir of many diseases with relevance for human and livestock health. Previous studies assessing gene expression changes as a consequence of infection in mallards have nearly universally used \u03b2-actin and\/or GAPDH as reference genes without confirming their suitability as normalisers. The use of reference genes at random, without regard for stability of expression across treatment groups, can result in erroneous interpretation of data. Here, eleven putative reference genes for use in gene expression studies of the mallard were evaluated, across six different tissues, using a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus infection model. Tissue type influenced the selection of reference genes, whereby different genes were stable in blood, spleen, lung, gastrointestinal tract and colon. \u03b2-actin and GAPDH generally displayed low stability and are therefore inappropriate reference genes in many cases. The use of different algorithms (GeNorm and NormFinder) affected stability rankings, but for both algorithms it was possible to find a combination of two stable reference genes with which to normalise qPCR data in mallards. These results highlight the importance of validating the choice of normalising reference genes before conducting gene expression studies in ducks. The fact that nearly all previous studies of the influence of pathogen infection on mallard gene expression have used a single, non-validated reference gene is problematic. The toolkit of putative reference genes provided here offers a solid foundation for future studies of gene expression in mallards and other waterfowl.\n","683":"\nGenome-wide dissection of the heat stress response (HSR) is necessary to overcome problems in crop production caused by global warming. To identify HSR genes, we profiled gene expression in two Chinese cabbage inbred lines with different thermotolerances, Chiifu and Kenshin. Many genes exhibited >2-fold changes in expression upon exposure to 0.5- 4 h at 45\u00b0C (high temperature, HT): 5.2% (2,142 genes) in Chiifu and 3.7% (1,535 genes) in Kenshin. The most enriched GO (Gene Ontology) items included 'response to heat', 'response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'response to temperature stimulus', 'response to abiotic stimulus', and 'MAPKKK cascade'. In both lines, the genes most highly induced by HT encoded small heat shock proteins (Hsps) and heat shock factor (Hsf)-like proteins such as HsfB2A (Bra029292), whereas high-molecular weight Hsps were constitutively expressed. Other upstream HSR components were also up-regulated: ROS-scavenging genes like glutathione peroxidase 2 (BrGPX2, Bra022853), protein kinases, and phosphatases. Among heat stress (HS) marker genes in Arabidopsis, only exportin 1A (XPO1A) (Bra008580, Bra006382) can be applied to B. rapa for basal thermotolerance (BT) and short-term acquired thermotolerance (SAT) gene. CYP707A3 (Bra025083, Bra021965), which is involved in the dehydration response in Arabidopsis, was associated with membrane leakage in both lines following HS. Although many transcription factors (TF) genes, including DREB2A (Bra005852), were involved in HS tolerance in both lines, Bra024224 (MYB41) and Bra021735 (a bZIP\/AIR1 [Anthocyanin-Impaired-Response-1]) were specific to Kenshin. Several candidate TFs involved in thermotolerance were confirmed as HSR genes by real-time PCR, and these assignments were further supported by promoter analysis. Although some of our findings are similar to those obtained using other plant species, clear differences in Brassica rapa reveal a distinct HSR in this species. Our data could also provide a springboard for developing molecular markers of HS and for engineering HS tolerant B. rapa. \n","684":"\nSignificant advances have been achieved in recent years to ameliorate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in animal models using gene therapy approaches rather than biological treatments. Although biological agents serve as antirheumatic drugs with suppressing proinflammatory cytokine\u00a0activities, they are usually accompanied by systemic immune suppression resulting from continuous or high systemic dose\u00a0injections of biological agents. Therefore, gene transfer approaches have opened an interesting perspective to deliver one or multiple genes in a target-specific or inducible manner for the sustained intra-articular expression of therapeutic products. Accordingly, many studies have focused on gene transferring methods in animal models by using one of the available approaches. In this study, the important strategies used to select effective genes for RA gene therapy have been outlined. Given the work done in this field, the future looks bright for\u00a0gene therapy as a new method in the clinical treatment of autoimmune diseases such as RA, and by ongoing efforts in this field, we hope to achieve feasible, safe, and effective treatment methods.\n\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","685":"\nThe aim of this study was to develop a set of reference genes whose expression is stable and suitable for normalization of target gene expression measured in asthma patients during anti-asthmatic treatment. Real-time qPCR was used to determine expression of 7 candidate reference genes (18S rRNA, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, POLR2A, RPL13A and RPL32) and 7 target genes in leukocytes from asthma patients before and after treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonist. Variance of Cq values was analyzed and stability ranking was determined with geNorm. We further investigated how the different normalization strategies affected the consistency of conclusions if the specific investigated target gene is down-regulated or up-regulated after anti-asthmatic therapy. The top-ranking reference genes determined by geNorm, when samples before and after therapy were analyzed (ACTB, B2M and GAPDH) were different from those (POLR2A and B2M) when only samples before treatment were analyzed. Using only a single reference gene for normalization of 7 target gene expression compared to our strategy, there would be as low as 19% of consistency in conclusions. We suggest the use of the geometric mean of ACTB, B2M and GAPDH for normalization of qPCR data of target genes in pharmacogenomics studies in asthma patients before and after anti-asthmatic therapy, however if gene expression is measured only before anti-asthmatic treatment, we recommend the use of the geometric mean of POLR2A and B2M. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Currently there is little information on reference gene stability in dental, periodontal and alveolar bone tissues of the rat, especially regarding orthodontic tooth movement and periodontitis. We therefore aimed to identify the best selection and number of reference genes under these experimental as well as physiological conditions.\nIn 7 male Fischer344-rats the upper left first and second molars were moved orthodontically for 2 weeks and in 7 more animals additionally subjected to an experimental periodontitis, whereas 7 animals were left untreated. Tissue samples of defined size containing both molars (without crowns) as well as the adjacent periodontal and alveolar bone tissue were retrieved and RNA extracted for RT-qPCR analyses. Nine candidate reference genes were evaluated and ranked according to their expression stability by 4 different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, comparative \u0394Cq).\nPPIB\/YWHAZ were the most stabile reference genes for the combined dental, periodontal and alveolar bone tissue of the rat overall, in untreated animals and rats with additional periodontitis, whereas PPIB\/B2M performed best in orthodontically treated rats with YWHAZ ranking third. Gene-stability ranking differed considerably between investigated groups. A combination of two reference genes was found to be sufficient for normalization in all cases.\nThe substantial differences in expression stability emphasize the need for valid reference genes, when aiming for meaningful results in relative gene expression analyses. Our results should enable researchers to optimize gene expression analysis in future studies by choosing the most suitable reference genes for normalization.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015.

This study analyzed the PHA synthase genes and the PHA-associated gene clusters from the two antarctic Pseudomonas isolates (UMAB-08 and UMAB-40) and the two antarctic Janthinobacterium isolates (UMAB-56 and UMAB-60) through whole-genome sequence analysis. The Pseudomonas isolates were found to carry PHA synthase genes which fall into two different PHA gene clusters, namely Class I and Class II, which are involved in the biosynthesis of short-chain-length-PHA (SCL-PHA) and medium-chain-length-PHA (MCL-PHA), respectively. On the other hand, the Janthinobacterium isolates carry a Class I and an uncharacterized putative PHA synthase genes. No other gene involved in PHA synthesis was detected in close proximity to the uncharacterized putative PHA synthase gene in the Janthinobacterium isolates, therefore it falls into a separate clade from the ordinary Class I, II, III and IV clades of PHA synthase (PhaC) phylogenetic tree. Multiple sequence alignment showed that the uncharacterized putative PHA synthase gene contains all the highly conserved amino acid residues and the proposed catalytic triad of PHA synthase. PHA biosynthesis and in vitro PhaC enzymatic assay results showed that this uncharacterized putative PHA synthase from Janthinobacterium sp. UMAB-60 is funtional. This report adds new knowledge to the PHA synthase database as we describe scarce information of PHA synthase genes and PHA-associated gene clusters from the antarctic bacterial isolates (extreme and geographically isolated environment) and comparing with those from non-antarctic PHA-producing bacteria.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Allelic series of the cereal mildew resistance genes Pm3 and Mla provide an excellent system for genetic and molecular analysis of resistance specificity. Despite this opportunity for molecular research, avirulence genes in mildews remain underexplored. Earlier work in barley powdery mildew (B.g. hordei) has shown that the reaction to some Mla resistance alleles is controlled by multiple genes. Similarly, several genes are involved in the specific interaction of wheat mildew (B.g. tritici) with the Pm3 allelic series. We found that two mildew genes control avirulence on Pm3f: one gene is involved in recognition by the resistance protein as demonstrated by functional studies in wheat and the heterologous host Nicotiana benthamiana. A second gene is a suppressor, and resistance is only observed in mildew genotypes combining the inactive suppressor and the recognized Avr. We propose that such suppressor\/avirulence gene combinations provide the basis of specificity in mildews. Depending on the particular gene combinations in a mildew race, different genes will be genetically identified as the \"avirulence\" gene. Additionally, the observation of two LINE retrotransposon-encoded avirulence genes in B.g. hordei further suggests that the control of avirulence in mildew is more complex than a canonical gene-for-gene interaction. To fully understand the mildew-cereal interactions, more knowledge on avirulence determinants is needed and we propose ways how this can be achieved based on recent advances in the field. \n","689":"\nThe present study attempted to identify the potential key genes and pathways of hyperlipidemia, and to investigate the possible mechanisms associated with them.\nThe array data of GSE3059 were downloaded, including thirteen samples of hyperlipidemia from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.

Using these two models, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by RNA-Seq analysis and used the newly-found knowledge of DEGs in comprehensive bioinformatic analyses to investigate key molecular events. Sequencing results were confirmed by experimental verification.\nOur study detected overlapping DEGs in the two models, of these 568 genes were upregulated and 117 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis demonstrated that the upregulated genes were associated with the biological processes of cell adhesion, cell migration and cell motility, while the metabolic processes of various substances were enriched for the downregulated genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that the upregulated pathways were mainly distributed in focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction and amoebiasis, while downregulated pathways focused on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, metabolic pathways and primary bile acid biosynthesis. These findings were further confirmed by protein-protein interaction network modeling. Hub genes Src, Pdgfb, Col15a1, Mmp9, Egfr were selected using centralities analyses and verified by qRT-PCR.\nWe profiled a global mRNA landscape in CLD to promote a complete understanding of transcriptomic events of this disease, offering candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the clinic.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Quantification of gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with stably expressed reference genes for normalization can effectively elucidate the biological functions of genes that regulate fruit development. However, the reference genes for data normalization in melon fruits have not yet been systematically validated. This study aims to assess the suitability of 20 genes for their potential use as reference genes in melon fruits. Expression variations of these genes were measured in 24 samples that represented different developmental stages of fertilized and parthenocarpic melon fruits by qRT-PCR analysis. GeNorm identified ribosomal protein L (CmRPL) and cytosolic ribosomal protein S15 (CmRPS15) as the best pair of reference genes, and as many as five genes including CmRPL, CmRPS15, TIP41-like family protein (CmTIP41), cyclophilin ROC7 (CmCYP7), and ADP ribosylation factor 1 (CmADP) were required for more reliable normalization. NormFinder ranked CmRPS15 as the best single reference gene, and RAN GTPase gene family (CmRAN) and TATA-box binding protein (CmTBP2) as the best combination of reference genes in melon fruits. Their effectiveness was further validated by parallel analyses on the activities of soluble acid invertase and sucrose phosphate synthase, and expression profiles of their respective encoding genes CmAIN2 and CmSPS1, as well as sucrose contents during melon fruit ripening. The validated reference genes will help to improve the accuracy of gene expression studies in melon fruits. \n","693":"\nThe discovery of the broad conservation of embryonic regulatory genes across animal phyla, launched by the cloning of homeotic genes in the 1980s, was a founding event in the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). While it had long been known that fundamental cellular processes, commonly referred to as housekeeping functions, are shared by animals and plants across the planet-processes such as the storage of information in genomic DNA, transcription, translation and the machinery for these processes, universal codon usage, and metabolic enzymes-Hox genes were different: mutations in these genes caused \"bizarre\" homeotic transformations of insect body parts that were certainly interesting but were expected to be idiosyncratic. The isolation of the genes responsible for these bizarre phenotypes turned out to be highly conserved Hox genes that play roles in embryonic patterning throughout Metazoa. How Hox genes have changed to promote the development of diverse body plans remains a central issue of the field of evo-devo today.

It depends on regulators that either repress or stimulate the transcription of genes, therefore controlling different biological functions. The Nuclear Receptor Corepressor 1 (NCOR1) is one of those co-repressors that regulate the transcription by facilitating the recruitment of HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7. In our article, by using an in silico approach, we evaluate the mutational status of NCOR1 in breast and lung tumors. We identified that NORC1 is mutated in more than 3% of breast tumors and lung adenocarcinomas and linked this fact with detrimental outcome in some subtypes, particularly in those that are hormone receptor negative. In addition to these findings, as mutations in this gene are deleterious, we confirmed that high levels of this gene were linked with good prognosis in the same tumor subtypes. Findings in the same direction were identified in lung adenocarcinomas, with mutations associated with detrimental prognosis and high expression with better outcome. In conclusion, hereby we describe the presence and prognostic role of mutations in the NCOR1 gene in hormone receptor negative breast and lung adenocarcinomas, and we also confirm that NCOR1 is a tumor suppressor gene.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve validated that the mRNA levels of these 5 genes exhibited excellent diagnostic efficiency for normal and tumor tissues. In addition, the protein levels of these 5 genes were also significantly higher in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues.

The majority of R genes from Solanaceae were grouped into 87 subfamilies, including 16 TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL) and 71 non-TNL subfamilies. Each subfamily was annotated manually, including identification of intron\/exon structure and intron phase. Interestingly, TNL subfamilies have similar intron phase patterns, while the non-TNL subfamilies have diverse intron phase due to frequent gain of introns. Prevalent presence\/absence polymorphic R gene loci were found among Solanaceae species, and an integrated map with 427 R loci was constructed. The pepper genome (2,042 in Chiltepin) has at least four times of R genes as in tomato (478 in Heinz1706). The high number of R genes in pepper genome is due to the amplification of R genes in a few subfamilies, such as the Rpi-blb2 and BS2 subfamilies.

The results of selective pressure analysis showed that the 15 genes were mainly subjected to negative selection. However, a significantly higher number of silent mutations, which could not be simply explained by selective pressure difference, were observed in the 12 FUB genes in Foc than in the three housekeeping genes. Infraspecies phylogeny and recombination detection analysis showed that significantly more horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events (normalized) had occurred in the FUB genes than in the three housekeeping genes. In addition, many of these events involved outgroup isolates and significantly increased the genetic diversity of FUB genes in Foc. The infraspecies phylogenetic analysis suggested that the polyphyletic phylogeny proposed for Foc requires further discussion, and the divergence of race 1, race 4, and the common ancestor of several F. oxysporum (Fo) isolates pathogenic to nonbanana plants should have diverged over a short period. Finally, our results suggest that the FUB genes in Fo should have benefited from HGT to gain a relatively high genetic diversity to respond to different host plants and environments despite mainly being subject to negative selection.\n","700":"\nCarotenoids participate in photosynthesis and photoprotection in oxygenic phototrophs.

In the present study, to elucidate the regulation of carotenoid synthesis of E. gracilis in response to environmental stimuli, we functionally identified phytoene desaturase genes (crtP1 and crtP2) and the \u03b6-carotene desaturase gene (crtQ) of this alga and analyzed expression of those genes and the composition of major carotenoids in cells grown under cold (20\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC) and high-intensity light (HL; 240 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdmol photon m-2 s-1) conditions. 20\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC-HL treatment increased the transcriptional level of the phytoene synthase gene (crtB), and crtP1 and crtP2, whose products catalyze the early steps of carotenoid biosynthesis in this alga.

When grown at 20\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC-HL, the cells showed a greater decrease in cell concentration and photosynthetic pigment contents than those in 20\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC-LL. \u03b2-Carotene, neoxanthin and diadinoxanthin contents were decreased by more than half in 20\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC-LL and 20\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC-HL treatments. On the other hand, when subjected to 20\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC-LL and 20\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC-HL, the cells retained a diatoxanthin content comparable with control cells. Our findings suggested that diatoxanthin plays crucial roles in the acclimation to cold and intense light condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a photosynthetic organism possessing dual crtP genes.\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The Author(s) 2018.

Gene loss may occur as a result of shifts in environment leading to changes in the intensity and\/or directionality of selection applied for the maintenance of specific genes. Gene loss may also occur in a more neutral manner, when gene functions are lost that were not subject to strong selection to be maintained, irrespective of changes to environment. Here, we used a pangenome-based approach to investigate patterns of gene loss across 15 bacterial species. We demonstrate that gene loss tends to occur mostly within a pool of genes that are less constrained within species, even in those strains from which they are not lost, and less conserved across bacterial species. Our results indicate that shifts in selection, resulting from shifts in environment are not required to explain the majority of gene loss events occurring within a diverse collection of bacterial species. Caution should therefore be taken when attributing differences in gene content to differences in environment.\n","702":"\nBioinformatics and comparative genomics analysis methods were used to predict unknown pathogen genes based on homology with identified or functionally clustered genes. In this study, the genes of common pathogens were analyzed to screen and identify genes associated with intracellular survival through sequence similarity, phylogenetic tree analysis and the \u03bb-Red recombination system test method. The total 38,952 protein-coding genes of common pathogens were divided into 19,775 clusters. As demonstrated through a COG analysis, information storage and processing genes might play an important role intracellular survival. Only 19 clusters were present in facultative intracellular pathogens, and not all were present in extracellular pathogens. Construction of a phylogenetic tree selected 18 of these 19 clusters. Comparisons with the DEG database and previous research revealed that seven other clusters are considered essential gene clusters and that seven other clusters are associated with intracellular survival. Moreover, this study confirmed that clusters screened by orthologs with similar function could be replaced with an approved uvrY gene and its orthologs, and the results revealed that the usg gene is associated with intracellular survival. The study improves the current understanding of intracellular pathogens characteristics and allows further exploration of the intracellular survival-related gene modules in these pathogens.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018.

QRT-PCR is a popular analytical methodology for studying gene expression and it has been used widely in studies of Aphis gossypii Glover in recent years. However, there is absence of study on the stability of the expression of reference genes in A. gossypii. In this study, eight commonly used candidate reference genes, including 18S, 28S, \u03b2-ACT, GAPDH, EF1\u03b1, RPL7, \u03b1-TUB, and TBP, were evaluated under various experimental conditions to assess their suitability for use in the normalization of qRT-PCR data. The optimal number of reference genes was determined using the geNorm program, and the suitability of particular reference genes was empirically validated by performing normalizations of expression data for the HSP70 gene. The results showed the most suitable combinations of reference genes for the different experimental conditions. For experiments based on divergent developmental stages, EF1\u03b1, \u03b2-ACT, and RPL7 are the optimal reference gene combination, both EF1\u03b1 and \u03b2-ACT are the optimal combination used in the experiments of different geographical populations, whereas for experiments of the temperature changes, the combination of GAPDH and RPL7 is optimal, both 18S and \u03b2-ACT are an optimal combination for feeding assay experiments. These research results should be useful for the selection of the suitable reference genes to obtain reliable qRT-PCR data in the gene expression study of A. gossypii.\n\u00a9 The Author 2016.

Thus, we carried out a weighted gene coexpression network analysis to identify core gene networks and key genes associated with NAFLD progression.\nWe enrolled 39 patients with mild NAFLD (fibrosis stages 0-2) and 21 with advanced NAFLD (fibrosis stages 3-4). Total RNA was extracted from frozen liver biopsies, and sequenced to capture a large dynamic range of expression levels.\nA total of 1777 genes differentially expressed between mild and advanced NAFLD (q-value <0.05) clustered into four modules. One module was enriched for genes that encode cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins, and are involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, and signaling. This module formed a scale-free network containing four hub genes (PAPLN, LBH, DPYSL3, and JAG1) overexpressed in advanced NAFLD. PAPLN is a component of the extracellular matrix, LBH and DPYSL3 are reported to be tumor suppressors, and JAG1 is tumorigenic. Another module formed a random network, and was enriched for genes that accumulate in the mitochondria. These genes were downregulated in advanced NAFLD, reflecting impaired mitochondrial function. However, the other two modules did not form unambiguous networks. KEGG analysis indicated that 71 differentially expressed genes were involved in \"pathways in cancer\". Strikingly, expression of half of all differentially expressed genes was inversely correlated with methylation of CpG sites (q-value <0.05). Among clinical parameters, serum type IV collagen 7\u00a0s was most strongly associated with the epigenetic status in NAFLD.\nNewly identified core gene networks suggest that the NAFLD liver undergoes mitochondrial dysfunction and fibrosis, and acquires tumorigenic potential epigenetically. Our data provide novel insights into the pathology and etiology of NAFLD progression, and identify potential targets for diagnosis and treatment.\n\u00a9 2017 The Japan Society of Hepatology.\n","705":"\nThe aim of this study was to identify the key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and high-risk gene mutations in breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\nRaw data (GSE36863) were downloaded from the database of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), including three DCIS samples (DCIS cell lines MCF10.DCIS, Sum102, and Sum225) and one normal control sample (normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A). The DEGs were analyzed using NOIseq and annotated via DAVID. Motif scanning in the promoter region of DEGs was performed via SeqPos. Additionally, single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were identified via GenomeAnalysisTK and SNV risk was assessed via VarioWatch. Mutant genes with a high frequency and risk were validated by RT-PCR analyses.\nFinally, 5391, 7073, and 7944 DEGs were identified in DCIS, Sum102, and Sum22 cell lines, respectively, when compared with MCF10A. VENN analysis of the three cell lines revealed 603 upregulated and 1043 downregulated DEGs, including 16 upregulated and 36 downregulated transcription factor (TF) genes. In addition, six TFs each (e.g., E2F1 and CREB1) were found to regulate the core up- and downregulated DEGs, respectively. Furthermore, SNV detection results revealed 1104 (MCF10.DCIS), 2833 (Sum102), and 1132 (Sum22) mutation sites. Four mutant genes (RWDD4, SDHC, SEPT7, and SFN) with high frequency and risk were identified. The results of RT-PCR analysis as well as bioinformatics analysis consistently demonstrated that the expression of RWDD4, SDHC, SEPT7, and SFN was downregulated in the tumor tissues as compared with that in adjacent non-tumor tissues.\nThe differentially expressed TFs, TFs regulating DEGs (e.g., E2F1 and CREB1), and high-frequency mutant genes (RWDD4, SDHC, SEPT7, and SFN) might play key roles in the pathogenesis of DCIS.\n","706":"\nCognitive impairments of different aetiology share alterations in iron and lipid homeostasis with mutual relationships. Since iron and cholesterol accumulation impact on neurodegenerative disease, the associated gene variants are appealing candidate targets for risk and disease progression assessment. In this light, we explored the role of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the main iron homeostasis genes and in the main lipoprotein transporter gene (APOE) in a cohort of 765 patients with dementia of different origin: Alzheimer's disease (AD) n = 276; vascular dementia (VaD), n = 255; mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 234; and in normal controls (n = 1086). In details, four genes of iron homeostasis (Hemochromatosis (HFE: C282Y, H63D), Ferroportin (FPN1: -8CG), Hepcidin (HAMP: -582AG), Transferrin (TF: P570S)), and the three major alleles of APOE (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4) were analyzed to explore causative interactions and synergies. In single analysis, HFE 282Y allele yielded a 3-fold risk reduction in the whole cohort of patients (P<0.0001), confirmed in AD and VaD, reaching a 5-fold risk reduction in MCI (P = 0.0019). The other iron SNPs slightly associated with risk reduction whereas APOE4 allele resulted in increased risk, reaching more than 7-fold increased risk in AD homozygotes (P = 0.001), confirmed to a lower extent in VaD and MCI (P = 0.038 and P = 0.013 respectively) as well as in the whole group (P<0.0001). Comparisons of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) among AD showed appreciable lowering in APOE4 carriers (P = 0.038), confirmed in the whole cohort of patients (P = 0.018). In interaction analysis, the HFE 282Y allele completely extinguished the APOE4 allele associated risk. Conversely, the coexistence in patients of a substantial number of iron SNPs accrued the APOE4 detrimental effect on MMSE. Overall, the analysis highlighted how a specific iron-allele burden, defined as different combinations of iron gene variants, might have different effects on cognitive impairment and might modulate the effects of established genetic risk factors such as APOE4. Our results suggest that established genetic risk factors might be affected by specific genetic backgrounds, making patients differently suited to manage iron accumulation adding new genetic insights in neurodegeneration. The recently recognized interconnections between iron and lipids, suggest that these pathways might share more than expected. We therefore extended to additional iron gene variants the newly proposed influencing mechanisms that HFE gene has on cholesterol metabolism. Our results have a strong translational potential promoting new pharmacogenetics studies on therapeutic target identification aimed at optimally tuning brain iron levels.\n","707":"\nHere we describe the systematic identification of single genes and gene pairs, whose knockout causes lethality in Escherichia coli K-12.

Although much has been learned about the molecular basis of melanoma genesis and progression, there is also increasing appreciation for the continuing discovery of melanoma genes to improve the genetic understanding of this malignancy. In the present study, melanoma candidate genes were identified by analysis of the common network from cancer type-specific RNA-Seq co-expression data and protein-protein interaction profiles. Then, an integrated network containing the known melanoma-related genes represented as seed genes and the putative genes represented as linker genes was generated using the subnetwork extraction algorithm. According to the network topology property of the putative genes, we selected seven key genes (CREB1, XPO1, SP3, TNFRSF1B, CD40LG, UBR1, and ZNF484) as candidate genes of melanoma. Subsequent analysis showed that six of these genes are melanoma-associated genes and one (ZNF484) is a cancer-associated gene on the basis of the existing literature. A signature comprising these seven key genes was developed and an overall survival analysis of 461 cutaneous melanoma cases was carried out. This seven-gene signature can accurately determine the risk profile for cutaneous melanoma tumors (log-rank P=3.27E-05) and be validated on an independent clinical cohort (log-rank P=0.028). The presented seven genes might serve as candidates for studying the molecular mechanisms and help improve the prognostic risk assessment, which have clinical implications for melanoma patients.\n","709":"\nDEAD-box (DDX) genes encode a group of RNA helicases that are highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and appear to participate in almost every aspect of RNA metabolism. Studies have been extensively done in yeast and human, in insect, beyond the flies, however, the information of these genes is limited. Here, we therefore identified and characterized 32 DDX genes from Locusta migratoria (L. migratoria), a crop pest. Overview of the gene structure and domain composition showed that the gene size varies significantly from one to fifteen exons, and the encoded proteins contain the conserved helicase core with various extensions at their amino and carboxyl termini. Phylogenetic trees informed that these locust DDX family members have orthologs in all insect species examined and can be classified into 30 subfamilies, all of them found counterparts in human, and most in yeast as well. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that these genes are expressed in all stages and tissues examined, overall with higher expression level at second and third-instar nymphs and in the reproductive organs. RNA interference (RNAi) analyses showed that seven genes cause lethal phenotype when silenced, of which five lead to defective midgut and gastric caecum, indicating that these genes are essential for the survival and maintenance of normal digestive organs of locust. These data provide a foundation for further functional analysis of these DDX genes in locust.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AGAMOUS-LIKE 6 (AGL6)-like genes are one of the most enigmatic subfamilies of the MADS-box family because of highly variable expression patterns and ambiguous functions, which have long puzzled researchers. A lot of AGL6 homologs have been identified from gymnosperms and angiosperms. However, only a few have been characterized, especially for basal angiosperm taxa. Magnolia wufengensis is a woody basal angiosperm from the family Magnoliaceae. In the current study, the phylogenesis, expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) patterns, and functions of two AGL6 homologs from M. wufengensis, MawuAGL6-1 and MawuAGL6-2, were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the two AGL6 duplicates may have arisen by gene duplication before the divergence of Magnoliaceae and Lauraceae, with the diversification of their expression and PPI patterns after gene duplication. Functional analysis revealed that, in addition to common functions in accelerating flowering, MawuAGL6-1 might be responsible for flower meristem determinacy, while MawuAGL6-2 is preferentially recruited to regulate tepal morphogenesis. These findings further advance our understanding of the evolution of phylogenesis, expression, interaction and functions of AGL6 lineage genes from basal angiosperms, as well as the entire AGL6 lineage genes, and the significance of AGL6 lineage genes in the evolution and biological diversity.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.

In many bacterial species, the yczE gene coding for the YczE protein is divergently transcribed with respect to an adjacent transcriptional regulator of the MocR family. According to in silico predictions, proteins named YczR are supposed to regulate the expression of yczE genes. These regulators linked to the yczE genes are predicted to constitute a subfamily within the MocR family. To put forward hypotheses amenable to experimental testing about the possible function of the YczE proteins, a phylogenetic profile strategy was applied. This strategy consists in searching for those genes that, within a set of genomes, co-occur exclusively with a certain gene of interest. Co-occurrence can be suggestive of a functional link. A set of 30 mycobacterial complete proteomes were collected. Of these, only 16 contained YczE proteins. Interestingly, in all cases each yczE gene was divergently transcribed with respect to a yczR gene. Two orthology clustering procedures were applied to find proteins co-occurring exclusively with the YczE proteins. The reported results suggest that YczE may be involved in the membrane translocation and metabolism of sulfur-containing compounds mostly in rapidly growing, low pathogenicity mycobacterial species. These observations may hint at potential targets for therapies to treat the emerging opportunistic infections provoked by the widespread environmental mycobacterial species and may contribute to the delineation of the genomic and physiological differences between the pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacterial species.\n","713":"\nBiological nitrogen fixation is an essential function of acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial communities. However, most acidophiles in AMD environments are uncultured microorganisms and little is known about the diversity of nitrogen-fixing genes and structure of nif gene cluster in AMD microbial communities. In this study, we used metagenomic sequencing to isolate nif genes in the AMD microbial community from Dexing Copper Mine, China. Meanwhile, a metagenome microarray containing 7,776 large-insertion fosmids was constructed to screen novel nif gene clusters. Metagenomic analyses revealed that 742 sequences were identified as nif genes including structural subunit genes nifH, nifD, nifK and various additional genes. The AMD community is massively dominated by the genus Acidithiobacillus. However, the phylogenetic diversity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms is much higher than previously thought in the AMD community. Furthermore, a 32.5-kb genomic sequence harboring nif, fix and associated genes was screened by metagenome microarray. Comparative genome analysis indicated that most nif genes in this cluster are most similar to those of Herbaspirillum seropedicae, but the organization of the nif gene cluster had significant differences from H. seropedicae. Sequence analysis and reverse transcription PCR also suggested that distinct transcription units of nif genes exist in this gene cluster. nifQ gene falls into the same transcription unit with fixABCX genes, which have not been reported in other diazotrophs before.

A total of 197 MLO genes were identified. They possessed 5-7 transmembrane domains, but only partially contained a calmodulin-binding domain. A total of 359 polymorphic sites and 142 haplotypes were found in 143 sequences, indicating the rich nucleotide diversity of MLO genes. The MLO genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes or scaffolds and were mainly located at the ends, forming clusters (24.1% genes), tandem duplicates (5.7%), and segment duplicates (36.2%). The MLO genes could be classified into three groups by phylogenetic analysis. The angiosperm genes were mainly in subgroup IA, Selaginella moellendorffii genes were in subgroup IA and IIIB, Physcomitrella patens genes were in subgroup IB and IIIA, and almost all algae genes were in group II. About half of the MLO genes had homologs within and across species. The Ka\/Ks values were all less than 1, varying 0.01-0.78, suggesting that purifying selection had occurred in MLO gene evolution. In tomato, RNA-seq data indicated that SlMLO genes were highly expressed in roots, followed by flowers, buds, and leaves, and also regulated by different biotic stresses. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that SlMLO genes could respond to tomato bacterial wilt, with SlMLO1, SlMLO2, SlMLO4, and SlMLO6 probably involved in the susceptibility response, whereas SlMLO14 and SlMLO16 being the opposite.

An interaction network of eight AMR genes along with 40 functional partners have been constructed and analysed. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted 20, 21 and 22 genes having significant roles in Cellular Component (CC), Molecular Functions (MF) and Biological Process (BP) respectively. Clustering analysis resulted in four densely interconnected clusters (C1-C4) which were associated with three AMR mechanisms that include the alteration in drug target (pbps, mur and van genes), complete replacement\/bypass of target sites (van genes) and ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter efflux pump mechanisms (msrA, EF_1680, EF_1682 and pbps).

In this study, we identified seventeen CLC genes in the genome of Nicotiana tabacum. A multiple sequence alignment showed that all of the predicted proteins shared a high sequence similarity and had a highly conserved GKxGPxxH motif. A gene structure analysis revealed that the NtCLC genes had highly divergent intron-exon patterns. A phylogenetic and conserved motif analysis revealed that the NtCLC family was divided into two clades, in a manner similar to other plants. We also evaluated the expression patterns of these NtCLC genes in different tissues and in plants treated with salt stress. The NtCLC genes had highly variable expression patterns, for example, the largely stem- and bud-specific expression patterns of NtCLC6 and NtCLC8, respectively. Salt stress treatment (300\u202fmM NaCl) induced the expression of NtCLC2, NtCLC3, and NtCLC12, suggesting that these genes might play a role in tobacco responses to salt stress. Furthermore, the concentration of Cl- in the NtCLC2- and NtCLC13-silenced plants showed an obvious lower and higher level, respectively, than the control plants. Thus, we indicated that NtCLC2 or NtCLC13 might play an important role in chloride transport or metabolism in tobacco. Together, these findings establish an empirical foundation for the further functional characterization of the NtCLC genes in tobacco.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results of conserved motif analysis showed that these SOS homologs contained similar protein structures. By analyzing the cis-elements in the promoters of those BjSOS genes, several hormone- and stress-related cis-elements were found. The results of gene expression analysis showed that the homologous genes were induced by abiotic stress and pathogen.

In this study, a genome-wide survey revealed the presence of an \u03b1-form RCA gene and a \u03b2-form RCA gene in the maize genome, herein referred to as ZmRCA\u03b1 and ZmRCA\u03b2, respectively. An analysis of genomic DNA and complementary DNA sequences suggested that alternative splicing of the ZmRCA\u03b2 precursor mRNA (premRNA) at its 3' untranslated region could produce two distinctive ZmRCA\u03b2 transcripts. Analyses by electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization-tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed that ZmRCA\u03b1 and ZmRCA\u03b2 encode larger and smaller polypeptides of approximately 46 and 43 kD, respectively. Transcriptional analyses demonstrated that the expression levels of both ZmRCA\u03b1 and ZmRCA\u03b2 were higher in leaves and during grain filling and that expression followed a specific cyclic day\/night pattern. In 123 maize inbred lines with extensive genetic diversity, the transcript abundance and protein expression levels of these two RCA genes were positively correlated with grain yield. Additionally, both genes demonstrated a similar correlation with grain yield compared with three C\u2084 photosynthesis genes. Our data suggest that, in addition to the \u03b2-form RCA-encoding gene, the \u03b1-form RCA-encoding gene also contributes to the synthesis of RCA in maize and support the hypothesis that RCA genes may play an important role in determining maize productivity.\n","722":"\nHoming based gene drives (HGD) possess the potential to spread linked cargo genes into natural populations and are poised to revolutionize population control of animals. Given that host encoded genes have been identified that are important for pathogen transmission, targeting these genes using guide RNAs as cargo genes linked to drives may provide a robust method to prevent disease transmission. However, effectiveness of the inclusion of additional guide RNAs that target separate genes has not been thoroughly explored. To test this approach, we generated a split-HGD in Drosophila melanogaster that encoded a drive linked effector consisting of a second gRNA engineered to target a separate host-encoded gene, which we term a gRNA-mediated effector (GME). This design enabled us to assess homing and knockout efficiencies of two target genes simultaneously, and also explore the timing and tissue specificity of Cas9 expression on cleavage\/homing rates. We demonstrate that inclusion of a GME can result in high efficiency of disruption of both genes during super-Mendelian propagation of split-HGD. Furthermore, both genes were knocked out one generation earlier than expected indicating the robust somatic expression of Cas9 driven by Drosophila germline-limited promoters. We also assess the efficiency of 'shadow drive' generated by maternally deposited Cas9 protein and accumulation of drive-induced resistance alleles along multiple generations, and discuss design principles of HGD that could mitigate the accumulation of resistance alleles while incorporating a GME.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Kandul et al.\n","723":"\nSalmonella enterica subsp. I serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis), one of the causative agents for non-typhoidal gastrointestinal diseases in humans is an intracellular bacterium and mechanism for its invasion into host cells is critical to cause infection. The virulence of the pathogen is explained by the expression of genes located on its pathogenicity islands, mostly encoded under SPI-1 and SPI-2. However, S. Typhimurium SL1344, despite sharing \u223c98% of its genome with S. Enteritidis P125109, lacks few regions of differences (ROD) that are hypothesized to impart virulence potential to S. Enteritidis. In this study, we created different mutants in the ROD9 island of S. Enteritidis, also referred as SPI-19 and identified a novel locus, SEN1005, encoding a hypothetical protein that is involved in its pathogenesis. \u0394SEN1005 displayed significantly reduced entry into cultured epithelial cells as well as uptake by macrophages and failed to cause acute colitis in C57BL\/6 mice at day 3 post-infection (p.i.). Additionally, the global transcriptome analysis revealed a highly repressed SPI-1 and other down-regulated genes responsible for flagellar assembly, chemotaxis and motility in the mutant which correlated with decreased invasion and abated inflammation as compared to the wild-type. Therefore, our findings revealed that \u0394SEN1005 was attenuated in vitro as well as in vivo and we propose this hypothetical protein to play a role in altering the expression of genes involved in Salmonella virulence.\n","724":"\nHuman osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common primary bone sarcoma, because of early metastasis and few treatment strategies. It has been reported that the tumorigenicity and self-renewal capacity of side population (SP) cells play roles in human OS via regulating of target genes. This study aims to complement the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that regulated between the SP cells and the non-SP cells from primary human OS and identify their functions and molecular pathways associated with OS.\nThe gene expression profile GSE63390 was downloaded, and bioinformatics analysis was made.\nOne hundred forty-one DEGs totally were identified. Among them, 72 DEGs (51.06%) were overexpressed, and the remaining 69 DEGs (48.94%) were underexpressed. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of target genes were performed. We furthermore identified some relevant core genes using gene-gene interaction network analysis such as EIF4E, FAU, HSPD1, IL-6, and KISS1, which may have a relationship with the development process of OS. We also discovered that EIF4E\/mTOR signaling pathway could be a potential research target for therapy and tumorigenesis of OS.\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the roles of DEGs coming from SP cells in the development of OS. However, these predictions need further experimental validation in future studies.\n","725":"\nThe evolution of genes and genomes after polyploidization has been the subject of extensive studies in evolutionary biology and plant sciences. While a significant number of duplicated genes are rapidly removed during a process called fractionation, which operates after the whole-genome duplication (WGD), another considerable number of genes are retained preferentially, leading to the phenomenon of biased gene retention. However, the evolutionary mechanisms underlying gene retention after WGD remain largely unknown. Through genome-wide analyses of sequence and functional data, we comprehensively investigated the relationships between gene features and the retention probability of duplicated genes after WGDs in six plant genomes, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), soybean (Glycine max), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and maize (Zea mays). The results showed that multiple gene features were correlated with the probability of gene retention. Using a logistic regression model based on principal component analysis, we resolved evolutionary rate, structural complexity, and GC3 content as the three major contributors to gene retention. Cluster analysis of these features further classified retained genes into three distinct groups in terms of gene features and evolutionary behaviors. Type I genes are more prone to be selected by dosage balance; type II genes are possibly subject to subfunctionalization; and type III genes may serve as potential targets for neofunctionalization. This study highlights that gene features are able to act jointly as primary forces when determining the retention and evolution of WGD-derived duplicated genes in flowering plants. These findings thus may help to provide a resolution to the debate on different evolutionary models of gene fates after WGDs.\n","726":"\nThe identification of the cancer driver genes is essential for personalized therapy. The mutation frequency of most driver genes is in the middle (2-20%) or even lower range, which makes it difficult to find the driver genes with low-frequency mutations. Other forms of genomic aberrations, such as copy number variations (CNVs) and epigenetic changes, may also reflect cancer progression. In this work, a method for identifying the potential cancer driver genes (iPDG) based on molecular data integration is proposed. DNA copy number variation, somatic mutation, and gene expression data of matched cancer samples are integrated. In combination with the method of iKEEG, the \"key genes\" of cancer are identified, and the change in their expression levels is used for auxiliary evaluation of whether the mutated genes are potential drivers. For a mutated gene, the concept of mutational effect is defined, which takes into account the effects of copy number variation, mutation gene itself, and its neighbor genes. The method mainly includes two steps: the first step is data preprocessing. First, DNA copy number variation and somatic mutation data are integrated. Then, the integrated data are mapped to a given interaction network, and the diffusion kernel is used to form the mutation effect matrix. The second step is to obtain the key genes by using the iKGGE method, and construct the connection matrix by means of the gene expression data of the key genes and mutation impact matrix of the mutated genes. Experiments on TCGA breast cancer and Glioblastoma multiforme datasets demonstrate that iPDG is effective not only to identify the known cancer driver genes but also to discover the rare potential driver genes. When measured by functional enrichment analysis, we find that these genes are clearly associated with these two types of cancers.\n","727":"\nHuman pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an invaluable tool for modeling diseases and hold promise for regenerative medicine. For understanding pluripotency and lineage differentiation mechanisms, a critical first step involves systematically cataloging essential genes (EGs) that are indispensable for hPSC fitness, defined as cell reproduction in this study. To map essential genetic determinants of hPSC fitness, we performed genome-scale loss-of-function screens in an inducible Cas9 H1 hPSC line cultured on feeder cells and laminin to identify EGs. Among these, we found FOXH1 and VENTX, genes that encode transcription factors previously implicated in stem cell biology, as well as an uncharacterized gene, C22orf43\/DRICH1. hPSC EGs are substantially different from other human model cell\u00a0lines, and EGs in hPSCs are highly context dependent with respect to different growth substrates. Our CRISPR screens establish parameters for\u00a0genome-wide screens in hPSCs, which will facilitate the characterization of unappreciated genetic regulators of hPSC biology.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Author(s).

Modern analysis of genes involved in virulence or pathogenicity usually implicate gene expression analysis most often performed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). However, for relative gene expression analysis pertinent reference genes have to be validated before using them as internal reference. This has not been reported for Vmm, so far. Therefore, eight commonly used housekeeping genes (ACT, CYP, EF1-\u03b1, G6PDH, GAPDH, L13, TUB, and UBQ) were cloned and evaluated for their expression stability by geNorm and NormFinder. Overall, all of the candidate reference genes were found to be suitable for gene expression analysis. After analysis of 10 samples from different strains and abiotic stress treatments, G6PDH appeared to be the most suitable reference gene, whereas GAPDH was the least suitable. Moreover, taking G6PDH combined with L13 or CYP as reference genes, improved the reliability of RT-qPCR significantly. The influence of the reference system on expression data was demonstrated by analyzing Vmmpg-1 encoding an endo-polygalacturonase gene. Pectinases are considered key pathogenicity factors for this fungus. In order to better understand the role of pectinases in pathogenicity of Vmm, RT-qPCR was used for expression analysis. Our results may provide a guideline for future studies on gene expression of V. mali var. mali by using RT-qPCR. \n","729":"\nColorectal cancer (CRC) caused more than 65,000 mortalities worldwide per year. It is a result of one or a combination of chromosomal instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite instability. SNRPA1 (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A) is a subunit of spliceosome complex that is involved in the RNA processing. Overexpression of SNRPA1 has been implicated in a variety of cancers including CRC. Besides from its role in mediating the RNA processing, the other aspects regarding its function in the progression of colorectal cancer have not been revealed.\nHerein, we combined regular gene overexpression or knock down in vitro and in vivo and microarray gene profiling analysis to decipher the unknow regulatory role of SNRPA1 in CRC.\nWe found SNRPA1 widely expression in many representative CRC cell lines. Knocking down expression of SNRPA1 by shRNA lentivirus inhibited the cell proliferation in vitro and impaired tumor formation from implanted CRC cells transduced with SNRPA1 silencing shRNA lentivirus in nude mice. It also promoted the cell apoptosis by upregulating the caspase 3\/7 activity. Additional microarray gene profiling analysis uncovered the gene interaction network of SNRPA1, special focus was placed on its association with tumor suppressor or oncogenes.\nAccording to the results of gene interaction network as well as qRT-PCR verification, it revealed that SNPRA1 regulates PIK3R1, VEGFC, MKI67, CDK1 in CRC. These novel findings identified new roles played by SNRPA1 in the progression of CRC and it may become a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of CRC.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified sequence variants, localized to non-coding genomic regions, associated with kidney function. Despite these robust observations, the mechanism by which variants lead to CKD remains a critical unanswered question. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis is a method to identify genetic variation associated with gene expression changes in specific tissue types. We hypothesized that an integrative analysis combining CKD GWAS and kidney eQTL results can identify candidate genes for CKD. We performed eQTL analysis by correlating genotype with RNA-seq-based gene expression levels in 96 human kidney samples. Applying stringent statistical criteria, we detected 1,886 genes whose expression differs with the sequence variants. Using direct overlap and Bayesian methods, we identified new potential target genes for CKD. With respect to one of the target genes, lysosomal beta A mannosidase (MANBA), we observed that genetic variants associated with MANBA expression in the kidney showed statistically significant colocalization with variants identified in CKD GWASs, indicating that MANBA is a potential target gene for CKD. The expression of MANBA was significantly lower in kidneys of subjects with risk alleles. Suppressing manba expression in zebrafish resulted in renal tubule defects and pericardial edema, phenotypes typically induced by kidney dysfunction. Our analysis shows that gene-expression changes driven by genetic variation in the kidney can highlight potential new target genes for CKD development.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 American Society of Human Genetics.

Although these hybrids show obvious heterosis, they are completely sterile due to spermatogenic arrest at the early stages of spermatogenesis, especially mitosis and meiosis I; the hybrids produce few spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, and no secondary spermatocytes. Although the mechanisms of spermatogenic arrest have been well investigated, transcriptomic differences between hybrid and the pure-species testes have not clarified. In the present study, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to generate testicular transcriptomic profiles for silver foxes, blue foxes, and reciprocal hybrids during the pre-breeding period and the breeding season. In total, 1,344,022 transcripts (\u2265200 bp) were generated; 1,057,724 genes were obtained; and 33,423 genes were shown to have fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM)\u00a0>\u00a00.3. To identify the hub genes associated with spermatogenesis arrest, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used. Nine modules were explored. Genes in only a single module were consistently downregulated in the hybrids as compared to the pure species; these genes were significantly associated with fox hybrid male infertility. Six of the genes in this module (CATSPERD, DMRTC2, RNF17, NME5, SPEF2, SPINK2) also play key roles in mitosis and meiosis during spermatogenesis. Therefore, these six genes might be associated with fox hybrid male infertility.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Here, one hundred forty-nine homeobox genes were identified from the Asian scorpion, Mesobuthus martensii (Chelicerata: Arachnida: Scorpiones: Buthidae) based on our newly assembled genome sequence with approximately 248\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0coverage. The identified homeobox genes were categorized into eight classes including 82 families: 67 ANTP class genes, 33 PRD genes, 11 LIM genes, five POU genes, six SINE genes, 14 TALE genes, five CUT genes, two ZF genes and six unclassified genes. Transcriptome data confirmed that more than half of the genes were expressed in adults. The homeobox gene diversity of the eight classes is similar to the previously analyzed Mandibulata arthropods. Interestingly, it is hypothesized that the scorpion M. martensii may have two Hox clusters. The first complete genome-wide analysis of homeobox genes in Chelicerata not only reveals the repertoire of scorpion, arachnid and chelicerate homeobox genes, but also shows some insights into the evolution of arthropod homeobox genes. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and stability of defined gene duplications\/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions. \n\u00a9 The Author 2014.

Applying a reverse-genetic approach to advance such a model, we used random and multitargeted primers to assay gene expression across perithecial development in Neurospora crassa. We found that functionally unclassified proteins accounted for most upregulated genes, whereas downregulated genes were enriched for diverse functions. Moreover, genes associated with developmental traits exhibited stage-specific peaks of expression. Expression increased significantly across sexual development for mating type gene mat a-1 and for mat A-1 specific pheromone precursor ccg-4. In addition, expression of a gene encoding a protein similar to zinc finger, stc1, was highly upregulated early in perithecial development, and a strain with a knockout of this gene exhibited arrest at the same developmental stage. A similar expression pattern was observed for genes in RNA silencing and signaling pathways, and strains with knockouts of these genes were also arrested at stages of perithecial development that paralleled their peak in expression. The observed stage specificity allowed us to correlate expression upregulation and developmental progression and to identify regulators of sexual development. Bayesian networks inferred from our expression data revealed previously known and new putative interactions between RNA silencing genes and pathways. Overall, our analysis provides a fine-scale transcriptomic landscape and novel inferences regarding the control of the multistage development process of sexual crossing and fruiting body development in N. crassa. \n","735":"\nSugars are critical for plant growth and development as suppliers of carbon and energy, as signal molecules, or as solute molecules for osmotic homeostasis. Monosaccharide transporter (MST) genes are involved in various processes of plant growth and development as well as in response to abiotic stresses. However, the evolution and their roles of MST genes in growth and development and in coping with abiotic stresses in rice are poorly known. Here, we identified 64 MST genes in rice genome, which are classified into seven subfamilies: STP, PLT, AZT, ERD, pGlcT, INT, and XTPH. MST genes are not evenly distributed between chromosomes (Chrs) with a bias to Chr 3, 4, 7, and 11, which could be a result of duplication of fragments harboring MST genes. In total, 12 duplication events were found in the rice MST family, among which, two pairs were derived from fragmental duplications and ten pairs were from tandem duplications. The synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of duplicate gene pairs demonstrated that the MST family was under a strong negative selection during the evolution process. Furthermore, a comprehensive expression analysis conducted in 11 different tissues, three abiotic stresses, five hormone treatments, and three sugar treatments revealed different expression patterns of MST genes and indicated diversified functions of them. Our results suggest that MST genes play important roles not only in various abiotic stresses but also in hormone and sugar responses. The present results will provide a vital insight into the functional divergence of the MST family in the future study.\n","736":"\n:Background: Exercise is one of the best nonpharmacologic therapies to treat hypertension. The blood pressure (BP) response to exercise is heritable. Yet, the genetic basis for the antihypertensive effects of exercise remains elusive. Methods: To assemble a prioritized gene signature, we performed a systematic review with a series of Boolean searches in PubMed (including Medline) from earliest coverage. The inclusion criteria were human genes in major BP regulatory pathways reported to be associated with: (1) the BP response to exercise; (2) hypertension in genome-wide association studies (GWAS); (3) the BP response to pharmacotherapy; (4a) physical activity and\/or obesity in GWAS; and (4b) BP, physical activity, and\/or obesity in non-GWAS. Included GWAS reports disclosed the statistically significant thresholds used for multiple testing. Results: The search yielded 1422 reports. Of these, 57 trials qualified from which we extracted 11 genes under criteria 1, 18 genes under criteria 2, 28 genes under criteria 3, 27 genes under criteria 4a, and 29 genes under criteria 4b. We also included 41 genes identified from our previous work. Conclusions: Deep-sequencing the exons of this systematically assembled signature of genes represents a cost and time efficient approach to investigate the genomic basis for the antihypertensive effects of exercise.\n","737":"\nPoplar is not only an important resource for the production of paper, timber and other wood-based products, but it has also emerged as an ideal model system for studying woody plants. To better understand the biological processes underlying various traits in poplar, e.g., wood development, a comprehensive functional gene interaction network is highly needed. Here, we constructed a genome-wide functional gene network for poplar (covering ~70% of the 41,335 poplar genes) and created the network web service PoplarGene, offering comprehensive functional interactions and extensive poplar gene functional annotations. PoplarGene incorporates two network-based gene prioritization algorithms, neighborhood-based prioritization and context-based prioritization, which can be used to perform gene prioritization in a complementary manner. Furthermore, the co-functional information in PoplarGene can be applied to other woody plant proteomes with high efficiency via orthology transfer. In addition to poplar gene sequences, the webserver also accepts Arabidopsis reference gene as input to guide the search for novel candidate functional genes in PoplarGene. We believe that PoplarGene (http:\/\/bioinformatics.caf.ac.cn\/PoplarGene and http:\/\/124.127.201.25\/PoplarGene) will greatly benefit the research community, facilitating studies of poplar and other woody plants.\n","738":"\nMulti Drug Resistance (MDR) in Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the major threats for emerging nosocomial infections in hospital environment. Multidrug-resistance in A. baumannii may be due to the implementation of multi-combination resistance mechanisms such as \u03b2-lactamase synthesis, Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs) changes, alteration in porin proteins and in efflux pumps against various existing classes of antibiotics. Multiple antibiotic resistance genes are involved in MDR. These resistance genes are transferred through plasmids, which are responsible for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance among Acinetobacter spp. In addition, these resistance genes may also have a tendency to interact with each other or with their gene products. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand the impact of these interactions in antibiotic resistance mechanism. Hence, our study focuses on protein and gene network analysis on various resistance genes, to elucidate the role of the interacting proteins and to study their functional contribution towards antibiotic resistance. From the search tool for the retrieval of interacting gene\/protein (STRING), a total of 168 functional partners for 15 resistance genes were extracted based on the confidence scoring system. The network study was then followed up with functional clustering of associated partners using molecular complex detection (MCODE). Later, we selected eight efficient clusters based on score. Interestingly, the associated protein we identified from the network possessed greater functional similarity with known resistance genes. This network-based approach on resistance genes of A. baumannii could help in identifying new genes\/proteins and provide clues on their association in antibiotic resistance. \nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Such screens are normally conducted in arrayed or pooled formats. There has been considerable interest in recent years to find new technological methods for conducting these gene-editing assays. We report here the first digital microfluidic method that can automate arrayed gene-editing in mammalian cells. Specifically, this method was useful in culturing lung cancer cells for up to six days, as well as implementing automated gene transfection and knockout procedures. In addition, a standardized imaging pipeline to analyse fluorescently labelled cells was also designed and implemented during these procedures. A gene editing assay for interrogating the MAPK\/ERK pathway was performed to show the utility of our platform and to determine the effects of knocking out the RAF1 gene in lung cancer cells. In addition to gene knockout, we also treated the cells with an inhibitor, Sorafenib Tosylate, to determine the effects of enzymatic inhibition. The combination of enzymatic inhibition and guide targeting on device resulted in lower drug concentrations for achieving half-inhibitory effects (IC50) compared to cells treated only with the inhibitor, confirming that lung cancer cells are being successfully edited on the device.

IL-18-deficient (Il18-\/-) mice exhibit obesity, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and depressive-like behavioral changes. Therefore, IL-18 has a number of important roles associated with immunity, energy homeostasis and psychiatric conditions. In the present study, gene expression in the brains of Il18-\/- mice was analyzed to identify genes associated with the depressive-like behaviors and other impairments displayed by Il18-\/- mice. Using whole genome microarray analysis, gene expression patterns in the brains of Il18+\/+ and Il18-\/- mice at 6 and 12 weeks of age were examined and compared. Subsequently, genes were categorized using Ingenuity\u00ae Pathway Analysis (IPA). At 12 weeks of age, 2,805 genes were identified using microarray analysis. Genes related to 'Major depression' and 'Depressive disorders' were identified by IPA core analysis, and 13 genes associated with depression were isolated. Among these genes, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1); protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 1 (Ptpn1); and urocortin 3 (Ucn3) were classed as depression-inducing and the other genes were considered depression-suppressing genes. Subsequently, the interactions between the microarray results at 6 weeks of age and the above three depression-inducing genes were analyzed to search for effector genes of depression at 12 weeks of age. This analysis identified cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4). The microarray analysis results were correlated with the results of reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Overall, the results suggest that Fgfr1, Ptpn1 and Ucn3 may be involved in depression-like changes and Ccnd1 and Nox4 regulate these three genes in IL-18-deficient mice.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019, Spandidos Publications.\n","741":"\nAs an extremely prevalent disease worldwide, allergic rhinitis (AR) is a condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa. To identify the finer molecular mechanisms associated with the AR susceptibility genes, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AR were investigated. The DEG expression and clinical data of the GSE19187 data\u00a0set were used for weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). After the modules related to AR had been screened, the genes in the module were extracted for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, whereby the genes enriched in the KEGG pathway were regarded as the pathway-genes. The DEGs in patients with AR were subsequently screened out from GSE19187, and the sensitive genes were identified in GSE18574 in connection with the allergen challenge. Two kinds of genes were compared with the pathway-genes in order to screen the AR susceptibility genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the capability of the susceptibility genes to distinguish the AR state. Based on the WGCNA in the GSE19187 data\u00a0set, 10 co-expression network modules were identified. The correlation analyses revealed that the yellow module was positively correlated with the disease state of AR. A total of 89 genes were found to be involved in the enrichment of the yellow module pathway. Four genes (CST1, SH2D1B, DPP4, and SLC5A5) were upregulated in AR and sensitive to allergen challenge, whose potentials were further confirmed by ROC curve. Taken together, CST1, SH2D1B, DPP4, and SLC5A5 are susceptibility genes to AR.\n\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

However, its mechanism still remains unclear. To explore the role of ecdysteroidogenic pathway (EP) genes in diapause process of bivoltine B. mori, the eggs of \"Qiufeng\", a bivoltine strain, were used as the study materials and arranged into diapause eggs producers (DEPs) and non-diapause eggs producers (NDEPs), respectively. The differential expression of EP genes between two groups was analysed during the early pupal stage. The expression of Shadow was significantly increased in the NDEPs in day-3 pupae and reached the peak simultaneously, indicating that Shadow was in coincidence with diapause process. To validate this hypothesis, a repression of Shadow by RNA interference was performed in day-2 pupae of NDEPs. The expression of Shadow was downregulated by RNAi, and \u03b2Ftz-F1, a downstream gene of EP, was also decreased. Furthermore, the genes encoding the kynurenine-synthetase were upregulated in the ovary, and Brown, AdenoK which link Shadow to the kynurenine-synthase gene were also upregulated in the fat body. The progeny eggs appeared a light purple colour at 48\u202fh after oviposition, revealing a certain tendency to diapause. We speculate that inhibition of Shadow upregulates 3-hydroxy-kynurenine synthesis by increasing the expression of Brown and AdenoK. In addition, Shadow was cloned, and expressed in E. coli for further functional study of Shadow protein. Our study provided insight into the role of EP genes in the process of diapause of B. mori.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We report the identification of WRKY domain (WD)-encoding genes from galegoid clade legumes chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and barrel medic (Medicago truncatula). In total, 78 and 98 WD-encoding genes were found in chickpea and barrel medic, respectively. Comparative analysis suggests the presence of both conserved and unique WRKYs, and expansion of WRKY family in M. truncatula primarily by tandem duplication. Exclusively found in galegoid legumes, CaWRKY16 and its orthologues encode for a novel protein having a transmembrane and partial Exo70 domains flanking a group-III WD. Genomic region of galegoids, having CaWRKY16, is more dynamic when compared with millettioids. In onion cells, fused CaWRKY16-EYFP showed punctate fluorescent signals in cytoplasm. The chickpea WRKY group-III genes were further characterized for their transcript level modulation during pathogenic stress and treatments of abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid (SA) by real-time PCR. Differential regulation of genes was observed during Ascochyta rabiei infection and SA treatment. Characterization of A. rabiei and SA inducible gene CaWRKY50 showed that it localizes to plant nucleus, binds to W-box, and have a C-terminal transactivation domain. Overexpression of CaWRKY50 in tobacco plants resulted in early flowering and senescence. The in-depth comparative account presented here for two legume WRKY genes will be of great utility in hastening functional characterization of crop legume WRKYs and will also help in characterization of Exo70Js. \n\u00a9 The Author 2016.

This study investigated the removal of the erythromycin ribosome methylase class F\u00a0(erm(F)) and class 1 integron-integrase (intI1) genes at each stage from two water resource recovery facilities in southern Arizona. Although genes were significantly reduced by Bardenpho treatment, erm(F) and intI1 were still observed in\u00a0\u2265 9 and 7 out of 12 secondary effluent samples. Primary processes via sedimentation or dissolved\u00a0air\u00a0flotation, as well as chlorine disinfection, did not significantly impact erm(F) and intI1 concentrations. Therefore, Bardenpho treatment was critical to reduce erm(F) and intI1. Concentrations of erm(F) and intI1 were compared with each other and other markers for anthropogenic pollution. Results from this study support intI1 as one suitable marker to measure erythromycin resistance genes in wastewater, as intI1 was found at higher concentrations, persisted more throughout treatment, and correlated with erm(F) at nearly every treatment stage. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Bardenpho treatment was the key process responsible for the reduction of intI1 and erm(F) genes during wastewater treatment. Primary treatment and chlorine disinfection did not impact erm(F) and intI1 gene concentrations. The intI1 gene is a suitable marker for measuring erm(F) genes in wastewater.\n\u00a9 2020 Water Environment Federation.\n","745":"\nTo decrease errors and increase accuracy and reliability of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results, the use of a reference gene is inevitable. Despite the industrial importance of genus Thymus, not any validated reference gene has not been reported for T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris which could limit such investigations. In this study, the expression stability of seven housekeeping genes including Actin, Cyclophilin-18, elongation factor-1A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S ribosomal RNA, Cullin, and Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein were evaluated in T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris which grown at four levels of drought stress using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Histone deacetylase-6 (HDA-6) gene was also used for validation of evaluated reference genes. In T. vulgaris, all of the algorithms similarly ranked elongation factor-1A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the two most stably expressed genes. In T. kotschyanus, only NormFinder and BestKeeper had a similar ranking and identified Actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the two most stably expressed genes, but geNorm algorithm ranked elongation factor-1A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the best two reference genes. On the other hand, all algorithms ranked 18S rRNA and Cyclophilin-18 as the least stable genes in T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris, respectively. Validation results indicated that there was a significant change (0.53-3.19 fold change) in relative expression of HDA-6 normalized by the best stable gene compare to the least ranked gene. Our study presented the first systematic validation of reference gene(s) selection in T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris and provided useful information to obtain more accurate qRT-PCR results in these species.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel (RAS EP) assessed published and other publicly available evidence supporting the association of 19 genes with RASopathy conditions. Using the semiquantitative literature curation method developed by the ClinGen Gene Curation Working Group, evidence for each gene was curated and scored for Noonan syndrome (NS), Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, NS with multiple lentigines, and Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair. The curated evidence supporting each gene-disease relationship was then discussed and approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel. Each association's strength was classified as definitive, strong, moderate, limited, disputed, or no evidence. Eleven genes were classified as definitively associated with at least one RASopathy condition. Two genes classified as strong for association with at least one RASopathy condition while one gene was moderate and three were limited. The RAS EP also disputed the association of two genes for all RASopathy conditions. Overall, our results provide a greater understanding of the different gene-disease relationships within the RASopathies and can help in guiding and directing clinicians, patients, and researchers who are identifying variants in individuals with a suspected RASopathy.\n\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","747":"\nLung squamous cell carcinoma (lung SCC) is a common type of malignancy. Its pathogenesis mechanism of tumor development is unclear. The aim of this study was to identify key genes for diagnosis biomarkers in lung SCC metastasis.\nWe searched and downloaded mRNA expression data and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to identify differences in mRNA expression of primary tumor tissues from lung SCC with and without metastasis. Gene co-expression network analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were used to explore the biological functions of the identified dysregulated genes.\nFour hundred and eighty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between lung SCC with and without metastasis. Nineteen modules were identified in lung SCC through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Twenty-three DEGs and 26 DEGs were significantly enriched in the respective pink and black module. KEGG pathway analysis displayed that 26 DEGs in the black module were significantly enriched in bile secretion pathway. Forty-nine DEGs in the two gene co-expression module were used to construct PPI network. CFTR in the black module was the hub protein, had the connectivity with 182 genes. The results of qRT-PCR displayed that FIGF, SFTPD, DYNLRB2 were significantly down-regulated in the tumor samples of lung SCC with metastasis and CFTR, SCGB3A2, SSTR1, SCTR, ROPN1L had the down-regulation tendency in lung SCC with metastasis compared to lung SCC without metastasis.\nThe dysregulated genes including CFTR, SCTR and FIGF might be involved in the pathology of lung SCC metastasis and could be used as potential diagnosis biomarkers or therapeutic targets for lung SCC.\n","748":"\nIron is a micronutrient for nearly all life on Earth. It can be used as an electron donor and electron acceptor by iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing microorganisms and is used in a variety of biological processes, including photosynthesis and respiration. While it is the fourth most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, iron is often limiting for growth in oxic environments because it is readily oxidized and precipitated. Much of our understanding of how microorganisms compete for and utilize iron is based on laboratory experiments. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing and surge in publicly available sequence data has made it possible to probe the structure and function of microbial communities in the environment. To bridge the gap between our understanding of iron acquisition, iron redox cycling, iron storage, and magnetosome formation in model microorganisms and the plethora of sequence data available from environmental studies, we have created a comprehensive database of hidden Markov models (HMMs) based on genes related to iron acquisition, storage, and reduction\/oxidation in Bacteria and Archaea. Along with this database, we present FeGenie, a bioinformatics tool that accepts genome and metagenome assemblies as input and uses our comprehensive HMM database to annotate provided datasets with respect to iron-related genes and gene neighborhood. An important contribution of this tool is the efficient identification of genes involved in iron oxidation and dissimilatory iron reduction, which have been largely overlooked by standard annotation pipelines. We validated FeGenie against a selected set of 28 isolate genomes and showcase its utility in exploring iron genes present in 27 metagenomes, 4 isolate genomes from human oral biofilms, and 17 genomes from candidate organisms, including members of the candidate phyla radiation. We show that FeGenie accurately identifies iron genes in isolates. Furthermore, analysis of metagenomes using FeGenie demonstrates that the iron gene repertoire and abundance of each environment is correlated with iron richness. While this tool will not replace the reliability of culture-dependent analyses of microbial physiology, it provides reliable predictions derived from the most up-to-date genetic markers. FeGenie's database will be maintained and continually updated as new genes are discovered.

According to observations, diseases with the same phenotype have the similar biological characteristics and genes associated with these same diseases tend to share common functional properties. Therefore, by applying machine learning methods, new disease genes are predicted based on previous ones. In recent studies, some semi-supervised learning methods, called Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PU-Learning) are used for predicting disease candidate genes. In this study, a novel method is introduced to predict disease candidate genes through gene expression profiles by learning hidden Markov models. In order to evaluate the proposed method, it is applied on a mixed part of 398 disease genes from three disease types and 12001 unlabeled genes. Compared to the other methods in literature, the experimental results indicate a significant improvement in favor of the proposed method.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Ammonia stress reduced ARGs associated with antibiotic efflux, especially the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of tet(L), due to free ammonia (FA) that changed the proton gradient of efflux system. Nonetheless, ARGs of antibiotic target alteration, especially ermB, were enriched under ammonia stress, which could be attributed to the initiation of the internal enhancer of the transferability of the broad host range plasmid, pAMbeta1. Statistical analysis elucidated the significant changes of ARGs are directly attributed to the mobile genetic elements (MGEs), but the little affected ARGs are mainly determined by the functional microbes reflected by nitrogen cycling genes (NCyc).

This work aimed to investigate the specific modules and feature genes associated with CAD.\nThree microarray datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included CAD and healthy samples. WGCNA was applied to identify highly preserved modules across the three datasets. MetaDE method was used to select differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with significant consistency. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the overlapping genes amongst the DEGs with significant consistency and in the preserved modules. Moreover, a combined machine learning of support vector machine and recursive feature elimination was used to further investigate the feature genes and pathways.\nNine highly preserved modules were detected in the WGCNA network, and 961 DEGs with significant consistency across the three datasets were selected using the metaDE method. A PPI network was constructed with the 158 overlapping genes. Ten genes were found to be involved in these KEGG pathways directly, including genes CD22, CD79B, CD81, CR1, IKBKE, MAP3K3, MAPK14, MMP9, NCF4, and SPP1.\nThe present work might provide novel insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of CAD.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019.

The results showed that ACT7, UBC and 18SrRNA were the stable reference genes in all of the tested samples. ACT7 and UBC showed high stability in different sampling times after the tribenuron treatment. UBC and 18SrRNA were the most suitable genes for different organs and growth stages.

Real-time PCR allows for rapid and reliable quantification of mRNA transcription. Reference genes are used as internal reaction control to normalise mRNA levels between different samples in order to allow for an exact comparison of mRNA transcription level.\nIn this study, twelve commonly used human reference genes were investigated in Human Embryonic Kidney Cell Lines (HEK293) using real-time qPCR with SYBR green. The genes included beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA), and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase\/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ). The stability of these reference genes was investigated using the geNorm application.\nThe range of expression stability in the genes analysed was (from the most stable to the least stable): UBC, TOP1, ATP5B, CYC1, GAPDH, SDHA, YWHAZ, CTB, 18S, EIFA-2, B2M and RPL13A. The optimal number of reference targets in the experiment was calculated to be 2 (geNorm V<0.15) when comparing a normalization factor based on the 2 or 3 most stable targets).\nThe expression stability varied greatly between the 12 candidate reference genes. UBC, TOP1, ATP5B, CYC1 and GAPDH respectively showed the highest stability in HEK293 cells based on both expression stability and expression level. Overall, our data suggest that UBC and TOP1show the least variation and the highest expression stability.

Research suggests that these patients may have altered circadian molecular genetic 'clocks' and that SD functions through 'resetting' dysregulated genes; additional factors may be involved, warranting further investigation. Leveraging advances in microarray technology enabling the transcriptome-wide assessment of gene expression, this study aimed to examine gene expression changes accompanying SD and recovery sleep in patients suffering from an episode of depression. Patients (N\u2009=\u200978) and controls (N\u2009=\u200915) underwent SD, with blood taken at the same time of day before SD, after one night of SD and after recovery sleep. A transcriptome-wide gene-by-gene approach was used, with a targeted look also taken at circadian genes. Furthermore, gene set enrichment, and longitudinal gene set analyses including the time point after recovery sleep, were conducted. Circadian genes were significantly affected by SD, with patterns suggesting that molecular clocks of responders and non-responders, as well as patients and controls respond differently to chronobiologic stimuli. Notably, gene set analyses revealed a strong widespread effect of SD on pathways involved in immune function and inflammatory response, such as those involved in cytokine and especially in interleukin signalling. Longitudinal gene set analyses showed that in responders these pathways were upregulated after SD; in non-responders, little response was observed. Our findings emphasize the close relationship between circadian, immune and sleep systems and their link to etiology of depression at the transcriptomic level.\n","755":"\nEvolutionarily related species often share a common order of genes along homeologous chromosomes. Here we report the collinearity disruption of genes located on homeologous chromosome 4 in Allium species. Ultra-sensitive fluorescence in situ hybridization with tyramide signal amplification (tyr-FISH) allowed the visualization of the alliinase multigene family, chalcon synthase gene and EST markers on Allium cepa and Allium fistulosum chromosomes. In A. cepa, bulb alliinase, root alliinase (ALL1) and chalcon synthase (CHS-B) genes were located in the long arm but EST markers (API18 and ACM082) were located in the short arm. In A. fistulosum, all the visualized genes and markers were located in the short arm. Moreover, root alliinase genes (ALL1 and AOB249) showed contrast patterns in number of loci. We suppose that the altered order of the genes\/markers is the result of a large pericentric inversion. To get insight into the evolution of the chromosome rearrangement, we mapped the bulb alliinase gene in phylogenetically close and distant species. In the taxonomic clade including A. fistulosum, A. altaicum, A. oschaninii and A. pskemense and in phylogenetically distant species A. roylei and A. nutans, the bulb alliinase gene was located on the short arm of chromosome 4 while, in A. cepa and A. schoenoprasum, the bulb alliinase gene was located on the long arm of chromosome 4. These results have encouraging implications for the further tracing of inverted regions in meiosis of interspecific hybrids and studding chromosome evolution. Also, this finding may have a practical benefit as closely related species are actively used for improving onion crop stock.\n","756":"\nCyanobacteria, a group of photosynthetic prokaryotes, dominate the earth with ~ 1015 g wet biomass. Despite diversity in habitats and an ancient origin, cyanobacterial phylum has retained a significant core genome. Cyanobacteria are being explored for direct conversion of solar energy and carbon dioxide into biofuels. For this, efficient cyanobacterial strains will need to be designed via metabolic engineering. This will require identification of target knockouts to channelize the flow of carbon toward the product of interest while minimizing deletions of essential genes. We propose \"Gene Conservation Index\" (GCI) as a quick measure to predict gene essentiality in cyanobacteria. GCI is based on phylogenetic profile of a gene constructed with a reduced dataset of cyanobacterial genomes. GCI is the percentage of organism clusters in which the query gene is present in the reduced dataset. Of the 750 genes deemed to be essential in the experimental study on S. elongatus PCC 7942, we found 494 to be conserved across the phylum which largely comprise of the essential metabolic pathways. On the contrary, the conserved but non-essential genes broadly comprise of genes required under stress conditions. Exceptions to this rule include genes such as the glycogen synthesis and degradation enzymes, deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase (DERA), glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (zwf) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase class1, which are conserved but non-essential. While the essential genes are to be avoided during gene knockout studies as potentially lethal deletions, the non-essential but conserved set of genes could be interesting targets for metabolic engineering. Further, we identify clusters of co-evolving genes (CCG), which provide insights that may be useful in annotation. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of the CCGs are demonstrated as data visualization tools that are complementary to the conventional heatmaps. Our dataset consists of phylogenetic profiles for 23,643 non-redundant cyanobacterial genes. We believe that the data and the analysis presented here will be a great resource to the scientific community interested in cyanobacteria.\n","757":"\nStaphylococcus aureus and cystic fibrosis (CF) are closely interlinked. To date, however, the impact of S. aureus culture in CF airways on lung function and disease progression has only been elucidated to a limited degree. This analysis aims to identify bacterial factors associated to clinical deterioration. Data were collected during an observational prospective multi-center study following 195 patients from 17 centers. The average follow-up time was 80 weeks. S. aureus isolates (n = 3180) were scanned for the presence of 25 virulence genes and agr-types using single and multiplex PCR. The presence of specific virulence genes was not associated to clinical deterioration. For the agr-types 1 and 4, however, a link to the subjects' clinical status became evident. Furthermore, a significant longitudinal decrease in the virulence gene quantity was observed. Analyses of the plasticity of the virulence genes revealed significantly increased plasticity rates in the presence of environmental stress. The results suggest that the phylogenetic background defines S. aureus pathogenicity rather than specific virulence genes. The longitudinal loss of virulence genes most likely reflects the adaptation process directed towards a persistent and colonizing rather than infecting lifestyle.\n","758":"\nSelenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for human health. Its beneficial effects are exerted by selenoproteins, which can be quantified in blood and used as molecular biomarkers of Se status. We hypothesize that the presence of genetic polymorphisms in selenoprotein genes may: (1) influence the gene expression of specific selenoproteins and (2) influence the pattern of global gene expression after Brazil nut supplementation. The study was conducted with 130 healthy volunteers in Sao Paulo, Brazil, who consumed one Brazil nut (300 \u03bcg\/Se) a day for eight weeks. Gene expression of GPX1 and SELENOP and genotyping were measured by real-time PCR using TaqMan Assays. Global gene expression was assessed by microarray using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChips. Brazil nut supplementation significantly increased GPX1 mRNA expression only in subjects with CC genotype at rs1050450 (p < 0.05). SELENOP mRNA expression was significantly higher in A-carriers at rs7579 either before or after supplementation (p < 0.05). Genotype for rs713041 in GPX4 affected the pattern of blood cell global gene expression. Genetic variations in selenoprotein genes modulated both GPX1 and SELENOP selenoprotein gene expression and global gene expression in response to Brazil nut supplementation.\n","759":"\nWe identified 672, 374, and 379 CYPs proteins encoded by the CYPs genes in Gossypiumhirsutum, Gossypiumraimondii, and Gossypiumarboreum, respectively.

The physiochemical properties of the proteins encoded by the CYP450 genes varied in terms of their protein lengths, molecular weight, isoelectric points (pI), and even grand hydropathy values (GRAVY). However, over 99% of the cotton proteins had GRAVY values below 0, which indicated that the majority of the proteins encoded by the CYP450 genes were hydrophilic in nature, a common property of proteins encoded by stress-responsive genes. Moreover, through the RNA interference (RNAi) technique, the expression levels of Gh_D07G1197 and Gh_A13G2057 were suppressed, and the silenced plants showed a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082) with a significant reduction in the concentration levels of glutathione (GSH), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and proline compared to the wild types under drought and salt stress conditions. Furthermore, the stress-responsive genes 1-Pyrroline\u207b5-Carboxylate Synthetase (GhP5CS), superoxide dismutase (GhSOD), and myeloblastosis (GhMYB) were downregulated in VIGS plants, but showed upregulation in the leaf tissues of the wild types under drought and salt stress conditions. In addition, CYP450-silenced cotton plants exhibited a high level of oxidative injury due to high levels of oxidant enzymes, in addition to negative effects on CMS, ELWL, RLWC, and chlorophyll content The results provide the basic foundation for future exploration of the proteins encoded by the CYP450 genes in order to understand the physiological and biochemical mechanisms in enhancing drought and salt stress tolerance in plants.\n","760":"\nDietary acrylamide, a thermally induced food contaminant, at a level (2 mg\/kg diet) typifying higher occurrence in certain food products - is neither an independent carcinogen nor a tumor promoter in the colon.

Three statistical algorithms (GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to analyze the stability of the 11 candidate reference genes to identify the most appropriate one. The results indicated that EF-1\u03b1 was the most stable reference gene in different birch tissues, ACT was the most stable reference gene for normal conditions, ACT and TEF were the most stable reference genes for salt stress treatment, TUB was the most stable reference gene for osmotic stress treatment, and ACT was the most appropriate choice in all samples of birch. In conclusion, the most appropriate reference genes varied among different experimental conditions. However, in this study, ACT was the optimum reference gene in all experimental groups, except in the different tissues group. GAPDH was the least stable candidate reference gene in all experimental conditions. In addition, three stress-induced genes (BpGRAS1, BpGRAS16, and BpGRAS19) were chosen to verify the stability of the selected reference genes in different tissues and under salt stress.

TAL effectors are secreted via the bacterial type III secretion system into plant cells, where they are directed to the nucleus, bind DNA in plant promoters and activate the expression of downstream genes. The DNA-binding activity of TAL effectors is carried out by a central domain which contains a series of repeat variable diresidues (RVDs) that dictate the sequence of bound nucleotides. TAL14Xam668 promotes virulence in Xam strain Xam668 and has been shown to activate multiple cassava genes. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to identify the full target repertoire of TAL14Xam668 in cassava, which includes over 50 genes. A subset of highly up-regulated genes was tested for activation by TAL14CIO151 from Xam strain CIO151. Although TAL14CIO151 and TAL14Xam668 differ by only a single RVD, they display differential activation of gene targets. TAL14CIO151 complements the TAL14Xam668 mutant defect, implying that shared target genes are important for TAL14Xam668 -mediated disease susceptibility. Complementation with closely related TAL effectors is a novel approach to the narrowing down of biologically relevant susceptibility genes of TAL effectors with multiple targets. This study provides an example of how TAL effector target activation by two strains within a single species of Xanthomonas can be dramatically affected by a small change in RVD-nucleotide affinity at a single site, and reflects the parameters of RVD-nucleotide interaction determined using designer TAL effectors in transient systems.\n\u00a9 2015 BSPP AND JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.\n","763":"\nReference genes, often referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs), are frequently used to normalize gene expression data based on the assumption that they are expressed at a constant level in the cells. However, several studies have shown that there may be a large variability in the gene expression levels of HKGs in various cell types. In a previous study, employing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) subjected to spontaneous differentiation, we observed that the expression of commonly used HKG varied to a degree that rendered them inappropriate to use as reference genes under those experimental settings. Here we present a substantially extended study of the HKG signature in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC), including nine global gene expression datasets from both hESC and human induced pluripotent stem cells, obtained during directed differentiation toward endoderm-, mesoderm-, and ectoderm derivatives. Sets of stably expressed genes were compiled, and a handful of genes (e.g., EID2, ZNF324B, CAPN10, and RABEP2) were identified as generally applicable reference genes in hPSCs across all cell lines and experimental conditions. The stability in gene expression profiles was confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis. Taken together, the current results suggest that differentiating hPSCs have a distinct HKG signature, which in some aspects is different from somatic cell types, and underscore the necessity to validate the stability of reference genes under the actual experimental setup used. In addition, the novel putative HKGs identified in this study can preferentially be used for normalization of gene expression data obtained from differentiating hPSCs. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 the American Physiological Society.\n","764":"\nWe evaluated microsatellite instability (MSI) in selected mismatch repair (MMR) and tumor suppressor (TS) genes with a view to exploring genetic changes associated with the occurrence of gastric cancer (GC). Moreover, expression of MSI positive genes was measured to get insights into molecular events operating in the tumor microenvironment. We anticipated discovering new molecular targets with potential as molecular biomarkers of gastric cancer. Of the 13 genes screened, we observed 15% to 52.5% MSI at eight microsatellite loci located in 3' UTR and coding regions of six genes (TGFBR2, PDCD4, MLH3, DLC1, MSH6, and MSH3). The union probability of different combinations of unstable microsatellite loci unveiled a set of four MSI markers from TGFBR2, PDCD4, MLH3, and MSH3 genes that allows detection of up to 85% incidences of GC. Significant downregulation of MLH3, PDCD4, TGFBR2, and DLC1 genes was observed in tumor tissues. Protein structure analyses of two unexplored targets, MSH3 (TG4) and MSH6 (A7), with MSI in the coding region, exhibited the loss of essential domains in the encoded aberrant protein hampering its function in the MMR machinery. The molecular markers thus identified could potentially be used as MSI biomarkers for the diagnosis of gastric tumorigenesis after further validation.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

They were uneven located on 5 chromosomes, where were mainly arranged in tandem clusters, and the phylogenetic analysis put forward further views on the evolutionary relationship and putative functions among the genes. The conserved motifs showed that the MLP proteins which contained motif 1 had the potential function, and tissue-specific expression analysis showed that apple MLP members had diverse biological roles. Furthermore, the results showed seven of the MdMLPs that harbored cis-acting regulatory elements in response to defense and stress, and our expression data proved that they were involved in biotic stresses. The present study provides new views to the evolution and regulation of MdMLP genes, which represent objectives of future research and incorporate in resistance-related molecular breeding projects.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is well established that the NAC transcription factor and salicylic acid (SA) signal pathway play essential roles in response to biotic stresses. However, simultaneous silencing of two target genes using VIGS in plants has been rarely reported. Therefore, in this report, we performed VIGS to silence simultaneously the SA-binding protein 2 (NbSABP2) and NbNAC1 in Nicotiana benthamiana to investigate the gene silencing efficiency of simultaneous silencing of two genes. We first cloned the full-length NbNAC1 gene, and the characterization of NbNAC1 was also analysed. Overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that the combination of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 was successfully amplified. Bacteria liquid PCR confirmed that the combination of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 was successfully inserted into the tobacco rattle virus vector. The results showed that the leaves from the NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 gene-silenced plants collapsed slightly, with browning at the base of petiole or veina. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the expression of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 were significantly reduced in 12 days post silenced plants after tobacco rattle virus infiltration compared with the control plants. Overall, our results suggest that VIGS can be used to silence simultaneously two target genes.\n","767":"\nGenetic risk for schizophrenia is due to the joint effect of multiple genes acting mainly at two different processes, prenatal\/perinatal neurodevelopment and adolescence\/early adulthood synapse maturation. Identification of important genes at the second process is of relevance for early intervention. The aim of this work was to identify gene co-expression modules with altered expression in schizophrenia during adolescence\/early adulthood. To this goal, we predicted frontal cortex gene expression in one discovery sample, the largest GWAS of schizophrenia from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, using S-prediXcan, and in one target sample, consisting of 625 schizophrenic patients and 819 controls from Spain, using prediXcan. Prediction models were trained on GTEx frontal cortex expression dataset. In parallel, we identified brain co-expression modules from BrainSpan using WGCNA. Then, we estimated polygenic risk scores based on predicted expression (PE-PRS) for each co-expression module in the target sample, based on PE-PRS model from the discovery sample. This analysis led to the identification of a module with mainly adolescence\/adulthood expression whose PE-PRS was significantly associated with schizophrenia. The module was significantly enriched in synaptic processes. Several hub genes at this module are drugabble, according to the drug-gene interaction database, and\/or involved in synaptic transmission, such as the voltage-gated ion channels SCN2B and KCNAB2, the calcium calmodulin kinases CAMK2A and CAMK1G, or genes involved in synaptic vesicle cycle, such as DNM1, or SYNGR1. Therefore, identification of this module may be the first step in patient stratification based on biology, as well as in drug design and drug repurposing efforts.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Phylogenetic profiles have been used for nearly twenty years to cluster genes based on measures such as the Euclidean distance between profile vectors. However, most approaches do not take into account the phylogenetic relationships amongst the profiled genomes, and overrepresentation of certain taxonomic groups (i.e., pathogenic species with many sequenced representatives) can skew the interpretation of profiles. We propose a new approach that uses a coevolutionary method defined by Pagel to account for the phylogenetic relationships amongst target organisms, and a hierarchical-clustering approach to define sets of genes with common distributions across the organisms. The clusters we obtain using our method show greater evidence of phylogenetic and functional clustering than a recently published approach based on hidden Markov models. Our clustering method identifies sets of amino-acid biosynthesis genes that constitute cohesive pathways, and motility\/chemotaxis genes with common histories of descent and lateral gene transfer.\n","769":"\nSome plant species have 'melanin-like' black seed pigmentation. However, the chemical and genetic nature of this 'melanin-like' black pigment have not yet been fully explored due to its complex structure and ability to withstand almost all solvents. Nevertheless, identification of genetic networks participating in trait formation is key to understanding metabolic processes involved in the expression of 'melanin-like' black seed pigmentation. The aim of the current study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in barley near-isogenic lines (NILs) differing by allelic state of the Blp (black lemma and pericarp) locus.\nRNA-seq analysis of six libraries (three replicates for each line) was performed. A total of 957 genome fragments had statistically significant changes in expression levels between lines BLP and BW, with 632 fragments having increased expression levels in line BLP and 325 genome fragments having decreased expression. Among identified DEGs, 191 genes were recognized as participating in known pathways. Among these were metabolic pathways including 'suberin monomer biosynthesis', 'diterpene phytoalexins precursors biosynthesis', 'cutin biosynthesis', 'cuticular wax biosynthesis', and 'phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, initial reactions'. Differential expression was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis of selected genes.\nMetabolic pathways and genes presumably associated with black lemma and pericarp colour as well as Blp-associated resistance to oxidative stress and pathogens, were revealed. We suggest that the black pigmentation of lemmas and pericarps is related to increased level of phenolic compounds and their oxidation. The effect of functional Blp on the synthesis of ferulic acid and other phenolic compounds can explain the increased antioxidant capacity and biotic and abiotic stress tolerance of black-grained cereals. Their drought tolerance and resistance to diseases affecting the spike may also be related to cuticular wax biosynthesis. In addition, upregulated synthesis of phytoalexins, suberin and universal stress protein (USP) in lemmas and pericarps of the Blp carriers may contribute to their increased disease resistance. Further description of the DEGs haplotypes and study of their association with physiological characteristics may be useful for future application in barley pre-breeding.\n","770":"\nQuantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a widely used technique to characterize changes in gene expression in complex cellular and tissue processes, such as cytoprotection or inflammation. The accurate assessment of changes in gene expression depends on the selection of adequate internal reference gene(s). Carbon monoxide (CO) affects several metabolic pathways and de novo protein synthesis is crucial in the cellular responses to this gasotransmitter. Herein a selection of commonly used reference genes was analyzed to identify the most suitable internal control genes to evaluate the effect of CO on gene expression in cultured cerebrocortical astrocytes. The cells were exposed to CO by treatment with CORM-A1 (CO releasing molecule A1) and four different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, Delta Ct and BestKeeper) were applied to evaluate the stability of eight putative reference genes. Our results indicate that Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) together with Ppia (peptidylpropyl isomerase A) is the most suitable gene pair for normalization of qRT-PCR results under the experimental conditions used. Pgk1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), Hprt1 (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase I), Sdha (Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex, Subunit A), Tbp (TATA box binding protein), Actg1 (actin gamma 1) and Rn18s (18S rRNA) genes presented less stable expression profiles in cultured cortical astrocytes exposed to CORM-A1 for up to 60 min. For validation, we analyzed the effect of CO on the expression of Bdnf and bcl-2. Different results were obtained, depending on the reference genes used. A significant increase in the expression of both genes was found when the results were normalized with Gapdh and Ppia, in contrast with the results obtained when the other genes were used as reference. These findings highlight the need for a proper and accurate selection of the reference genes used in the quantification of qRT-PCR results in studies on the effect of CO in gene expression.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Whole genome duplication events (WGDs) have been recognized as an important evolutionary force. The potential relationship between the separation of neighboring genes and WGDs needs to be investigated. In this study, we investigated whether there is a potential relationship between separated neighboring gene pairs and WGDs, and the mechanism by which neighboring genes are separated. Additionally, we studied whether neighboring genes tend to show intrachromosomal colocalization after their neighborhood was disrupted and the factors facilitating the intrachromosomal colocalization of separated neighboring genes.\nThe separation of neighboring gene pairs is closely related to whole genome duplication events. Furthermore, we found that there is a double linear relationship between separated neighboring genes, total genes, and WGDs. The process of separation of neighboring genes caused by WGDs is also not random but abides by the double linear model. Separated neighboring gene pairs tend to show intrachromosomal colocalization. The conservativism of separated neighboring genes and histone modification facilitate the intrachromosomal colocalization of neighboring genes after their separation.\nThese results provide new insight into the understanding of evolutionary roles of locations and the relationship of neighboring gene pairs with whole genome duplications. Furthermore, understanding the proposed mechanism for intrachromosomal colocalization of separated genes benefits our knowledge of chromosomal interactions in the nucleus.\n","772":"\nSexual reproduction in filamentous ascomycete fungi results in the production of highly specialized sexual tissues, which arise from relatively simple, vegetative mycelia. This conversion takes place after the recognition of and response to a variety of exogenous and endogenous cues, and relies on very strictly regulated gene, protein, and metabolite pathways. This makes studying sexual development in fungi an interesting tool in which to study gene-gene, gene-protein, and protein-metabolite interactions. This review provides an overview of some of the most important genes involved in this process; from those involved in the conversion of mycelia into sexually-competent tissue, to those involved in the development of the ascomata, the asci, and ultimately, the ascospores.\n","773":"\nTo accurately measure gene expression using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), reliable reference gene(s) are required for data normalization. Corchorus capsularis, an annual herbaceous fiber crop with predominant biodegradability and renewability, has not been investigated for the stability of reference genes with qRT-PCR. In this study, 11 candidate reference genes were selected and their expression levels were assessed using qRT-PCR. To account for the influence of experimental approach and tissue type, 22 different jute samples were selected from abiotic and biotic stress conditions as well as three different tissue types. The stability of the candidate reference genes was evaluated using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper programs, and the comprehensive rankings of gene stability were generated by aggregate analysis. For the biotic stress and NaCl stress subsets, ACT7 and RAN were suitable as stable reference genes for gene expression normalization. For the PEG stress subset, UBC, and DnaJ were sufficient for accurate normalization. For the tissues subset, four reference genes TUB\u03b2, UBI, EF1\u03b1, and RAN were sufficient for accurate normalization. The selected genes were further validated by comparing expression profiles of WRKY15 in various samples, and two stable reference genes were recommended for accurate normalization of qRT-PCR data. Our results provide researchers with appropriate reference genes for qRT-PCR in C. capsularis, and will facilitate gene expression study under these conditions. \n","774":"\nThis study describes a novel approach to reducing the challenges of highly nonlinear multiclass gene expression values for cancer diagnosis. To build a fruitful system for cancer diagnosis, in this study, we introduced two levels of gene selection such as filtering and embedding for selection of potential genes and the most relevant genes associated with cancer, respectively. The filter procedure was implemented by developing a fuzzy rough set (FR)-based method for redefining the criterion function of f-information (FI) to identify the potential genes without discretizing the continuous gene expression values. The embedded procedure is implemented by means of a water swirl algorithm (WSA), which attempts to optimize the rule set and membership function required to classify samples using a fuzzy-rule-based multiclassification system (FRBMS). Two novel update equations are proposed in WSA, which have better exploration and exploitation abilities while designing a self-learning FRBMS. The efficiency of our new approach was evaluated on 13 multicategory and 9 binary datasets of cancer gene expression. Additionally, the performance of the proposed FRFI-WSA method in designing an FRBMS was compared with existing methods for gene selection and optimization such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) on all the datasets. In the global cancer map with repeated measurements (GCM_RM) dataset, the FRFI-WSA showed the smallest number of 16 most relevant genes associated with cancer using a minimal number of 26 compact rules with the highest classification accuracy (96.45%). In addition, the statistical validation used in this study revealed that the biological relevance of the most relevant genes associated with cancer and their linguistics detected by the proposed FRFI-WSA approach are better than those in the other methods. The simple interpretable rules with most relevant genes and effectively classified samples suggest that the proposed FRFI-WSA approach is reliable for classification of an individual's cancer gene expression data with high precision and therefore it could be helpful for clinicians as a clinical decision support system.\n","775":"\nIn recent years, dozens of Arabidopsis and rice CCCH-type zinc finger genes have been functionally studied, many of which confer important traits, such as abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, delayed leaf senescence and improved plant architecture. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is an important bioenergy crop. Identification of agronomically important genes and\/or loci is an important step for switchgrass molecular breeding. Annotating switchgrass CCCH genes using translational genomics methods will help further the goal of understanding switchgrass genetics and creating improved varieties.\nTaking advantage of the publicly-available switchgrass genomic and transcriptomic databases, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of switchgrass CCCH genes (PvC3Hs). A total of 103 PvC3Hs were identified and divided into 21 clades according to phylogenetic analysis. Genes in the same clade shared similar gene structure and conserved motifs. Chromosomal location analysis showed that most of the duplicated PvC3H gene pairs are in homeologous chromosomes. Evolution analysis of 19 selected PvC3H pairs showed that 42.1% of them were under diversifying selection. Expression atlas of the 103 PvC3Hs in 21 different organs, tissues and developmental stages revealed genes with higher expression levels in lignified cells, vascular cells, or reproductive tissues\/organs, suggesting the potential function of these genes in development. We also found that eight PvC3Hs in Clade-XIV were orthologous to ABA- or stress- responsive CCCH genes in Arabidopsis and rice with functions annotated. Promoter and qRT-PCR analyses of Clade-XIV PvC3Hs showed that these eight genes were all responsive to ABA and various stresses.\nGenome-wide analysis of PvC3Hs confirmed the recent allopolyploidization event of tetraploid switchgrass from two closely-related diploid progenitors. The short time window after the polyploidization event allowed the existence of a large number of PvC3H genes with a high positive selection pressure onto them. The homeologous pairs of PvC3Hs may contribute to the heterosis of switchgrass and its wide adaptation in different ecological niches. Phylogenetic and gene expression analyses provide informative clues for discovering PvC3H genes in some functional categories. Particularly, eight PvC3Hs in Clade-XIV were found involved in stress responses. This information provides a foundation for functional studies of these genes in the future.\n","776":"\nCAPA and pyrokinin (PK) neuropeptides are produced from two different genes, capa and pyrokinin, respectively. In this study, we identified and characterized the capa and pyrokinin genes from the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera). The capa gene encodes two CAPA-PVK (periviscerokinin) peptides (DAGLFPFPRVamide and EQLIPFPRVamide) and one CAPA-DH (diapause hormone; NGASGNGGLWFGPRLamide). The pyrokinin gene encodes three PK2 peptides (QLVSFRPRLamide, SPPFAPRLamide, and FYAPFSPRLamide). The whole-mounting immunocytochemistry revealed the neurons contained PRXamide-like peptides throughout the cerebral ganglia (CRG), gnathal ganglia (GNG), thoracic ganglia (TG), and abdominal ganglia (AG). A pair of neurosecretory cells in the CRG and three cell clusters in the GNG were found with the axonal projections extended through the lateral side. A pair of immunostained cells were found in the TG, while three pairs of cells were present in the fused AG. Different expression patterns of capa and pyrokinin genes were observed in the CRG-GNG, TG, and AG. The capa gene was highly expressed in the AG tissue, whereas the pyrokinin gene was strongly expressed in the CRG-GNG. Interestingly, different developmental stages showed similar expressions of both genes, with the highest from the first nymph, gradually decreasing to the female adult. Comparison of peptide sequences encoded from pyrokinin genes showed the PK1 peptide is lost in Heteroptera suborders including H. halys, but retained in other suborders. The missing PK1 from the pyrokinin gene might be compensated by CAPA-DH (=PK1-like) produced by the capa gene.\n\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","777":"\nTo examine the associations of five GWAS-identified genes with carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in a biracial sample from the Bogalusa Heart Study, and evaluate their participation in gene-smoking interactions.\nFar wall IMTs of common carotid arteries were measured using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound. Both the gene-smoking interactions and single-marker associations were evaluated by linear models of carotid IMT levels, while the gene-based analyses were assessed through the truncated product method. A Bonferroni multiple testing correction was applied.\nMarker rs7840785 (PINX1) was significantly associated with right carotid IMT (p=0.0003) using all participants; mean levels for the CC, TC, and TT genotypes were 0.74 (0.73 to 0.75), 0.76 (0.75 to 0.78), and 0.78 (0.75, 0.81), respectively. Similar trends were observed in blacks (p=0.0031) and whites (p=0.0118). Marker rs7844465 (ZHX2) was significantly associated with left carotid IMT in whites (p=0.0005); mean IMT levels for the GG, TG, and TT genotypes were 0.73 (0.71 to 0.74), 0.75 (0.74 to 0.77) and 0.78 (0.75 to 0.81), respectively. Marker rs6841473 (EDNRA) modified the association between smoking and left carotid IMT in blacks (p=2.79\u00d710(-5)). In addition, gene-based analysis demonstrated that EDNRA and ZHX2 were associated with left carotid IMT in the white and overall participants, respectively, while PINX1 was associated with right carotid IMT in both blacks and whites.\nWe identified two novel markers that were associated with IMT in both blacks and whites. One gene-smoking interaction was identified in blacks only. Three genes showed gene-based associations with IMT levels. However, genetic markers with small effects may have been missed due to the limited number of black participants.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we report analysis of eight candidate reference genes (ACTIN, UBQ, EF-1\u03b1, UBC, IF-4\u03b1, TUB, PP2A, and HIS), which were screened from the genome and transcriptome data in Brassica juncea. Four statistical analysis softwares geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder were used to test the reliability and stability of gene expression of the reference genes. To further validate the stability of reference genes, the expression levels of two CYCD3 genes (BjuB045330 and BjuA003219) were studied. In addition, all genes in the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase\/hydrolase (XTH) family were identified in B. juncea and their patterns at different periods of stem enlargement were analyzed. Results indicated that UBC and TUB genes showed stable levels of expression and are recommended for future research. In addition, XTH genes were involved in regulation of stem enlargement expression. These results provide new insights for future research aiming at exploring important functional genes, their expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms for mustard development.\n","779":"\nIt has been shown that gene body DNA methylation is associated with gene expression. However, whether and how deviation of gene body DNA methylation between duplicate genes can influence their divergence remains largely unexplored. Here, we aim to elucidate the potential role of gene body DNA methylation in the fate of duplicate genes. We identified paralogous gene pairs from Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) genomes and reprocessed their single-base resolution methylome data. We show that methylation in paralogous genes nonlinearly correlates with several gene properties including exon number\/gene length, expression level and mutation rate. Further, we demonstrated that divergence of methylation level and pattern in paralogs indeed positively correlate with their sequence and expression divergences. This result held even after controlling for other confounding factors known to influence the divergence of paralogs. We observed that methylation level divergence might be more relevant to the expression divergence of paralogs than methylation pattern divergence. Finally, we explored the mechanisms that might give rise to the divergence of gene body methylation in paralogs. We found that exonic methylation divergence more closely correlates with expression divergence than intronic methylation divergence. We show that genomic environments (e.g., flanked by transposable elements and repetitive sequences) of paralogs generated by various duplication mechanisms are associated with the methylation divergence of paralogs. Overall, our results suggest that the changes in gene body DNA methylation could provide another avenue for duplicate genes to develop differential expression patterns and undergo different evolutionary fates in plant genomes. \n","780":"\nMicrobes play essential roles in arsenic transformation in the environment. Microbial arsenite oxidation is catalyzed by either of two distantly related arsenite oxidases, referred to as AIO and ARX. The arx genes encoding ARX and its regulatory proteins were originally defined in the genomes of gammaproteobacteria isolated from an alkaline soda lake. The arx gene cluster has been identified in a limited number of bacteria, predominantly in gammaproteobacteria isolated from lakes characterized by high pH and high salinity. In the present study, a novel arsenite-oxidizing betaproteobacterium, strain M52, was isolated from a hot spring microbial mat. The strain oxidized arsenite under both microaerophilic and nitrate-reducing conditions at nearly neutral pH. Genome analysis revealed that the strain possesses the arx gene cluster in its genome and lacks genes encoding AIO. Inspection of the bacterial genomes available in the GenBank database revealed that the presence of this gene cluster is restricted to genomes of Proteobacteria, mainly in the classes Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. In these genomes, the structure of the gene cluster was generally well-conserved, but genes for regulatory proteins were lacking in genomes of strains belonging to a specific lineage. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that ARX encoded in the genomes can be divided into three groups, and strain M52 belongs to a group specific for organisms living in low-salt environments. The ArxA protein encoded in the genome of strain M52 was characterized by the presence of a long insertion, which was specifically observed in the same group of ARX. In clone library analyses with a newly designed primer pair, a diverse ArxA sequence with a long insertion was detected in samples of lake water and hot spring microbial mat, characterized by low salinity and a nearly neutral pH. Among the isolated bacterial strains whose arsenite oxidation has been demonstrated, strain M52 is the first betaproteobacterium that possesses the arx genes, the first strain encoding ARX of the group specific for low-salt environments, and the first organism possessing the gene encoding ArxA with a long insertion.\n","781":"\nMammalian carboxylesterase (CES or Ces) genes encode enzymes that participate in xenobiotic, drug, and lipid metabolism in the body and are members of at least five gene families. Tandem duplications have added more genes for some families, particularly for mouse and rat genomes, which has caused confusion in naming rodent Ces genes. This article describes a new nomenclature system for human, mouse, and rat carboxylesterase genes that identifies homolog gene families and allocates a unique name for each gene. The guidelines of human, mouse, and rat gene nomenclature committees were followed and \"CES\" (human) and \"Ces\" (mouse and rat) root symbols were used followed by the family number (e.g., human CES1). Where multiple genes were identified for a family or where a clash occurred with an existing gene name, a letter was added (e.g., human CES4A; mouse and rat Ces1a) that reflected gene relatedness among rodent species (e.g., mouse and rat Ces1a). Pseudogenes were named by adding \"P\" and a number to the human gene name (e.g., human CES1P1) or by using a new letter followed by ps for mouse and rat Ces pseudogenes (e.g., Ces2d-ps). Gene transcript isoforms were named by adding the GenBank accession ID to the gene symbol (e.g., human CES1_AB119995 or mouse Ces1e_BC019208). This nomenclature improves our understanding of human, mouse, and rat CES\/Ces gene families and facilitates research into the structure, function, and evolution of these gene families. It also serves as a model for naming CES genes from other mammalian species.\n","782":"\nThe powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 was physically and comparatively mapped by newly developed markers. Seven candidate genes were verified to be required for Pm21 -mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew. Pm21, a gene derived from wheat wild relative Dasypyrum villosum, has been transferred into common wheat and widely utilized in wheat resistance breeding for powdery mildew. Previously, Pm21 has been located to the bin FL0.45-0.58 of 6VS by using deletion stocks. However, its fine mapping is still a hard work. In the present study, 30 gene-derived 6VS-specific markers were obtained based on the collinearity among genomes of Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza and Triticeae, and then physically and comparatively mapped in the bin FL0.45-0.58 and its nearby chromosome region. According to the maps, the bin FL0.45-0.58 carrying Pm21 was closely flanked by the markers 6VS-03 and 6VS-23, which further narrowed the orthologous regions to 1.06\u00a0Mb in Brachypodium and 1.38\u00a0Mb in rice, respectively. Among the conserved genes shared by Brachypodium and rice, four serine\/threonine protein kinase genes (DvMPK1, DvMLPK, DvUPK and DvPSYR1), one protein phosphatase gene (DvPP2C) and two transcription factor genes (DvGATA and DvWHY) were confirmed to be required for Pm21-mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) and transcriptional pattern analyses. In summary, this study gives new insights into the genetic basis of the Pm21 locus and the disease resistance pathways mediated by Pm21.\n","783":"\nDue to the complexity of the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, traditional differentially-expressed gene selection methods cannot detect disease-associated genes accurately. Recent studies have shown that consensus-guided unsupervised feature selection (CGUFS) performs well in feature selection for identifying disease-associated genes. Since the random initialization of the feature selection matrix in CGUFS results in instability of the final disease-associated gene set, for the purposes of this study we proposed an ensemble method based on CGUFS-namely, ensemble consensus-guided unsupervised feature selection (ECGUFS) in order to further improve the accuracy of disease-associated genes and the stability of feature gene sets. We also proposed a bagging integration strategy to integrate the results of CGUFS. Lastly, we conducted experiments with Huntington's disease RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data and obtained the final feature gene set, where we detected 287 disease-associated genes. Enrichment analysis on these genes has shown that postsynaptic density and the postsynaptic membrane, synapse, and cell junction are all affected during the disease's progression. However, ECGUFS greatly improved the accuracy of disease-associated gene prediction and the stability of the disease-associated gene set. We conducted a classification of samples with labels based on the linear support vector machine with 10-fold cross-validation. The average accuracy is 0.9, which suggests the effectiveness of the feature gene set.\n","784":"\nEarlier we showed that human genome contains many evolutionarily young or novel genes with tumor-specific or tumor-predominant expression. We suggest calling such genes Tumor Specifically Expressed, Evolutionarily New (TSEEN) genes. In this paper we performed a study of the evolutionary ages of different classes of human genes, using homology searches in genomes of different taxa in human lineage. We discovered that different classes of human genes have different evolutionary ages and confirmed the existence of TSEEN gene classes. On the other hand, we found that oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes and differentiation genes are among the oldest gene classes in humans and their evolution occurs concurrently. These findings confirm non-trivial predictions made by our hypothesis of the possible evolutionary role of hereditary tumors. The results may be important for better understanding of tumor biology.

To gain deep knowledge of the host transcriptional response of pigs to poly I:C stimulation, in the present study, we cultured and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of piglets of one Chinese indigenous breed (Dapulian) and one modern commercial breed (Landrace) with poly I:C, and compared their transcriptional profiling using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Our results indicated that poly I:C stimulation can elicit significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes in Dapulian (g\u00a0=\u00a0290) as well as Landrace (g\u00a0=\u00a085). We also performed gene set analysis using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) package, and identified some significantly enriched gene sets in Dapulian (g\u00a0=\u00a018) and Landrace (g\u00a0=\u00a021). Most of the shared DE genes and gene sets were immune-related, and may play crucial rules in the immune response of poly I:C stimulation. In addition, we detected large sets of significantly DE genes and enriched gene sets when comparing the gene expression profile between the two breeds, including control and poly I:C stimulation groups. Besides immune-related functions, some of the DE genes and gene sets between the two breeds were involved in development and growth of various tissues, which may be correlated with the different characteristics of the two breeds. The DE genes and gene sets detected herein provide crucial information towards understanding the immune regulation of antiviral responses, and the molecular mechanisms of different genetic resistance to viral infection, in modern and indigenous pigs.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Wang et al.\n","786":"\nCanine B-cell lymphoma GRN was reconstructed from gene expression data in the STRING and MiMI databases.

Such studies rely on behavioral as well as genetic and epigenetic analyses using various biotechniques. Of these technologies, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR is considered as a mature discovery and validation tool. Nevertheless, the interpretation of the resulting gene expression necessitates the establishment of reliable internal controls for normalization. No study has been performed to identify reliable reference genes in multigenerational settings.\nThe primary aim was to evaluate the stability of 16 reference gene candidates in Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to nicotine and their two subsequent generations for determining the most reliable reference genes for multigenerational study.\nWe exposed C. elegans to nicotine in the F0 generation and investigated the relative stabilities of 16 housekeeping genes in L4 larvae across three generations (F0, F1, and F2) using five statistical approaches (geNorm, \u2206Ct method, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder).\ngeNorm shows that CDC-42 and Y45F10D.4 were the most stable reference genes. Based on NormFinder, TBA-1, EIF3.C, ARP-6, CDC-42, and MDH2 may serve as the top reliable reference genes. Comparative \u2206Ct method ranked TBA-1, CDC-42, EIF3.C, ARP-6, and Y45F10D.4 as the most stable reference genes. BestKeeper shows that Y45F10D.4, F35G12.2, TBA-1, CDC-42, and CSQ-1were better reference genes. Overall, TBA-1, CDC-42, EIF3.C, ARP-6, and Y45F10D.4 were the most reliable reference genes for mutigenerational nicotine-exposed study.\nOf the 16 tested gene candidates, TBA-1 and CDC-42 were the two most stable reference genes for performing reliable gene expression normalization in the multigenerational impact of nicotine exposure.\n","788":"\nPromoter motifs in Entamoeba histolytica were earlier analysed using microarray data with lower dynamic range of gene expression. Additionally, previous transcriptomic studies did not provide information on the nature of highly transcribed genes, and downstream promoter motifs important for gene expression. To address these issues we generated RNA-Seq data and identified the high and low expressing genes, especially with respect to virulence potential. We analysed sequences both upstream and downstream of start site for important motifs.\nWe used RNA-Seq data to classify genes according to expression levels, which ranged six orders of magnitude. Data were validated by reporter gene expression. Virulence-related genes (except AIG1) were amongst the highly expressed, while some kinases and BspA family genes were poorly expressed. We looked for conserved motifs in sequences upstream and downstream of the initiation codon. Following enrichment by AME we found seven motifs significantly enriched in high expression- and three in low expression-classes. Two of these motifs (M4 and M6) were located downstream of AUG, were exclusively enriched in high expression class, and were mostly found in ribosomal protein, and translation-related genes. Motif deletion resulted in drastic down regulation of reporter gene expression, showing functional relevance. Distribution of core promoter motifs (TATA, GAAC, and Inr) in all genes revealed that genes with downstream motifs were not preferentially associated with TATA-less promoters. We looked at gene expression changes in cells subjected to growth stress by serum starvation, and experimentally validated the data. Genes showing maximum up regulation belonged to the low or medium expression class, and included genes in signalling pathways, lipid metabolism, DNA repair, Myb transcription factors, BspA, and heat shock. Genes showing maximum down regulation belonged to the high or medium expression class. They included genes for signalling factors, actin, Ariel family, and ribosome biogenesis factors.\nOur analysis has added important new information about the E. histolytica transcriptome. We report for the first time two downstream motifs required for gene expression, which could be used for over expression of E. histolytica genes. Most of the virulence-related genes in this parasite are highly expressed in culture.\n","789":"\nRecent times have seen an enormous growth of \"omics\" data, of which high-throughput gene expression data are arguably the most important from a functional perspective. Despite huge improvements in computational techniques for the functional classification of gene sequences, common similarity-based methods often fall short of providing full and reliable functional information. Recently, the combination of comparative genomics with approaches in functional genomics has received considerable interest for gene function analysis, leveraging both gene expression based guilt-by-association methods and annotation efforts in closely related model organisms. Besides the identification of missing genes in pathways, these methods also typically enable the discovery of biological regulators (i.e., transcription factors or signaling genes). A previously built guilt-by-association method is MORPH, which was proven to be an efficient algorithm that performs particularly well in identifying and prioritizing missing genes in plant metabolic pathways. Here, we present MorphDB, a resource where MORPH-based candidate genes for large-scale functional annotations (Gene Ontology, MapMan bins) are integrated across multiple plant species. Besides a gene centric query utility, we present a comparative network approach that enables researchers to efficiently browse MORPH predictions across functional gene sets and species, facilitating efficient gene discovery and candidate gene prioritization. MorphDB is available at http:\/\/bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be\/webtools\/morphdb\/morphDB\/index\/. We also provide a toolkit, named \"MORPH bulk\" (https:\/\/github.com\/arzwa\/morph-bulk), for running MORPH in bulk mode on novel data sets, enabling researchers to apply MORPH to their own species of interest.\n","790":"\nPrimary glioblastoma (pGBM) is the most common and lethal type of neoplasms in the central nervous system, while the existing biomarkers, lacking consideration on the stemness changes of GBM cells, are not specific enough to predict the complex prognosis respectively. We aimed to build a high-efficiency prediction gene signature related to GBM cell stemness and investigate its prognostic value in primary glioblastoma.\nDifferentially expressed genes were screened in GSE23806 database. The selected genes were then verified by univariate Cox regression in 591 patients from four enormous independent databases, including the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), TCGA, REMBRANDT and GSE16011. Finally, the intersected genes were included to build the gene signature. GO analysis and GSEA were carried out to explore the bioinformatic implication.\nThe novel five-gene signature was used to identify high- and low-risk groups in the four databases, and the high-risk group showed notably poorer prognosis (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Gene ontology (GO) terms including \"immune response\", \"apoptotic process\", and \"angiogenesis\" were picked out by GO analysis and GSEA, which revealed that the gene signature was highly possibly related to the stemness of GSCs and predicting the prognosis of GBM effectively.\nWe built a gene signature with five glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) relevant genes, and predicted the survival in four independent databases effectively, which is possibly related to the stemness of GSCs in pGBM. Several GO terms were investigated to be correlated to the signature. The signature can predict the prognosis of glioblastoma efficiently.\n","791":"\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs) encoded genes, tetracycline resistance genes, and the coa based typing of Staphylococcus aureus isolates in the Southwest of Iran.\nAntimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was carried out by agar disk diffusion methods. Two sets of multiplex PCR mixture were used for detection of AME genes and tet genes. All of the isolates were typed with the coagulase gene typing method. Of the 121 isolates, 29.75% and 47.93% were resistant to at least one aminoglycosides and tetracyclines, respectively.\nThe aac(6')-Ie-aph(2\") was the most frequent gene (97.22%), and aph (3')-IIIa and ant (4')-Ia genes were detected in 61.11% and 11.11% of aminoglycoside resistant isolates, respectively. The tetK and tetM genes were detected in 82.75% and 56.9% of tetracycline resistant isolates, respectively. Overall 31.4% of isolates were MRSA. Totally 17 distinct coa gene RFLP patterns, numbered C1 to C17, were observed. The C5 was the most frequent coa type with 31 isolates.\nThe aac(6')-Ie-aph(2\") and aph (3')-IIIa genes were the most important genes contributing to aminoglycosides resistance, while resistance to tetracyclines was mediated by tetK and tetM genes. Interestingly all S. aureus with C5 as the most prevalent coa-type were resistant to at least one of the aminoglycoside antibiotics and tetracycline simultaneously. Moreover, 30 out of 31 isolates with this coa type were MRSA, indicating the importance of the C5 coa-type in MRSA strains and also in isolates that were resistant to aminoglycosides and tetracycline.\n","792":"\nTrichomonas vaginalis is the etiologic agent of trichomonosis, the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease worldwide. This infection is associated with several health consequences, including cervical and prostate cancers and HIV acquisition. Gene expression analysis has been facilitated because of available genome sequences and large-scale transcriptomes in T. vaginalis, particularly using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), one of the most used methods for molecular studies. Reference genes for normalization are crucial to ensure the accuracy of this method. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic validation of reference genes has not been performed for T. vaginalis. In this study, the transcripts of nine candidate reference genes were quantified using qRT-PCR under different cultivation conditions, and the stability of these genes was compared using the geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The most stable reference genes were \u03b1-tubulin, actin and DNATopII, and, conversely, the widely used T. vaginalis reference genes GAPDH and \u03b2-tubulin were less stable. The PFOR gene was used to validate the reliability of the use of these candidate reference genes. As expected, the PFOR gene was upregulated when the trophozoites were cultivated with ferrous ammonium sulfate when the DNATopII, \u03b1-tubulin and actin genes were used as normalizing gene. By contrast, the PFOR gene was downregulated when the GAPDH gene was used as an internal control, leading to misinterpretation of the data. These results provide an important starting point for reference gene selection and gene expression analysis with qRT-PCR studies of T. vaginalis. \n","793":"\nReal-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is a powerful technique used for the relative quantification of target genes, using reference (housekeeping) genes for normalization to ensure the generation of accurate and robust data. A systematic examination of the suitability of endogenous reference genes for gene expression studies in endometrial cancer tissues is absent. The aims of this study were therefore to identify and evaluate from the thirty-two possible reference genes from a TaqMan(\u00ae) array panel their suitability as an internal control gene. The mathematical software packages geNorm qBasePLUS identified Pumilio homolog 1 (Drosophila) (PUM1), ubiquitin C (UBC), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 (MRPL19) and peptidylpropyl isomerase A (cyclophilin A) (PPIA) as the best reference gene combination, whilst NormFinder identified MRPL19 as the best single reference gene, with importin 8 (IPO8) and PPIA being the best combination of two reference genes. BestKeeper ranked MRPL19 as the most stably expressed gene. In addition, the study was validated by examining the relative expression of a test gene, which encodes the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). A significant difference in CB1 mRNA expression between malignant and normal endometrium using MRPL19, PPIA, and IP08 in combination was observed. The use of MRPL19, IPO8 and PPIA was identified as the best reference gene combination for the normalization of gene expression levels in endometrial carcinoma. This study demonstrates that the arbitrary selection of endogenous control reference genes for normalization in qRT-PCR studies of endometrial carcinoma, without validation, risks the production of inaccurate data and should therefore be discouraged. \n\u00a9 The Author 2015.

The aim of this study was to screen and verify hub genes involved in OA and explore potential molecular mechanisms. The expression profiles of GSE12021 and GSE55235 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which contained 39 samples, including 20 osteoarthritis synovial membranes and 19 matched normal synovial membranes. The raw data were integrated to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and were deeply analyzed by bioinformatics methods. The Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment of DEGs were performed by DAVID and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) online analyses, respectively. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the DEGs were constructed based on data from the STRING database. The top 10 hub genes VEGFA, IL6, JUN, IL1\u03b2, MYC, IL4, PTGS2, ATF3, EGR1, and DUSP1 were identified from the PPI network. Module analysis revealed that OA was associated with significant pathways including TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and osteoclast differentiation. The qRT-PCR result showed that the expression level of IL6, VEGFA, JUN, IL-1\u03b2, and ATF3 was significantly increased in OA samples (p < 0.05), and these candidate genes could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of OA.\n","795":"\nIn recent years, there has been increased interest in the study of the molecular processes that affect semen traits. In this study, our aim was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions associated with four semen traits (motility, progressive motility, number of sperm cells per ejaculate and total morphological defects) in two commercial pig lines (L1: Large White type and L2: Landrace type). Since the number of animals with both phenotypes and genotypes was relatively small in our dataset, we conducted a weighted single-step genome-wide association study, which also allows unequal variances for single nucleotide polymorphisms. In addition, our aim was also to identify candidate genes within QTL regions that explained the highest proportions of genetic variance. Subsequently, we performed gene network analyses to investigate the biological processes shared by genes that were identified for the same semen traits across lines.\nWe identified QTL regions that explained up to 10.8% of the genetic variance of the semen traits on 12 chromosomes in L1 and 11 chromosomes in L2. Sixteen QTL regions in L1 and six QTL regions in L2 were associated with two or more traits within the population. Candidate genes SCN8A, PTGS2, PLA2G4A, DNAI2, IQCG and LOC102167830 were identified in L1 and NME5, AZIN2, SPATA7, METTL3 and HPGDS in L2. No regions overlapped between these two lines. However, the gene network analysis for progressive motility revealed two genes in L1 (PLA2G4A and PTGS2) and one gene in L2 (HPGDS) that were involved in two biological processes i.e. eicosanoid biosynthesis and arachidonic acid metabolism. PTGS2 and HPGDS were also involved in the cyclooxygenase pathway.\nWe identified several QTL regions associated with semen traits in two pig lines, which confirms the assumption of a complex genetic determinism for these traits. A large part of the genetic variance of the semen traits under study was explained by different genes in the two evaluated lines. Nevertheless, the gene network analysis revealed candidate genes that are involved in shared biological pathways that occur in mammalian testes, in both lines.\n","796":"\nAcute myocardial infarction induces ventricular remodeling, which is implicated in dilated heart and heart failure. The pathogenical mechanism of myocardium remodeling remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to identify key genes and networks for myocardium remodeling following ischemia\u2011reperfusion\u00a0(IR). First, the mRNA expression data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database were downloaded to identify differences in mRNA expression of the IR heart at days\u00a02 and\u00a07. Then, weighted gene co\u2011expression network analysis, hierarchical clustering, protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were used to identify key genes and networks for the heart remodeling process following IR. A total of 3,321 differentially expressed genes were identified during the heart remodeling process. A total of 6\u00a0modules were identified through gene co\u2011expression network analysis. GO and KEGG analysis results suggested that each module represented a different biological function and was associated with different pathways. Finally, hub genes of each module were identified by PPI network construction. The present study revealed that heart remodeling following IR is a complicated process, involving extracellular matrix organization, neural development, apoptosis and energy metabolism. The dysregulated genes, including SRC proto\u2011oncogene, non\u2011receptor tyrosine kinase, discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 1, ATP citrate lyase, RAN, member RAS oncogene family, tumor protein p53, and polo like kinase\u00a02, may be essential for heart remodeling following IR and may be used as potential targets for the inhibition of heart remodeling following acute myocardial infarction.\n","797":"\nWing dimorphism is considered as an adaptive trait of insects. Brown planthoppers (BPHs) Nilaparvata lugens, a serious pest of rice, are either macropterous or brachypterous. Genetic and environmental factors are both likely to control wing morph determination in BPHs, but the hereditary law and genes network are still unknown. Here, we investigated changes in gene expression levels between macropterous and brachypterous BPHs by creating artificially bred morphotype lines. The nearly pure-bred strains of macropterous and brachypterous BPHs were established, and their transcriptomes and gene expression levels were compared. Over ten-thousand differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between macropterous and brachypterous strains were found in the egg, nymph, and adult stages, and the three stages shared 6523 DEGs. The regulation of actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, tight junction, and adherens junction pathways were consistently enriched with DEGs across the three stages, whereas insulin signaling pathway, metabolic pathways, vascular smooth muscle contraction, platelet activation, oxytocin signaling pathway, sugar metabolism, and glycolysis\/gluconeogenesis were significantly enriched by DEGs in a specific stage. Gene expression trend profiles across three stages were different between the two strains. Eggs, nymphs, and adults from the macropterous strain were distinguishable from the brachypterous based on gene expression levels, and genes that were related to wing morphs were differentially expressed between wing strains or strain \u00d7 stage. A proposed mode based on genes and environments to modulate the wing dimorphism of BPHs was provided.\n","798":"\nDrought is one of the most severe threats to the growth, development and yield of plant. In order to unravel the molecular basis underlying the high tolerance of pitaya (Hylocereus undatus) to drought stress, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA microarray approaches were firstly combined to identify the potential important or novel genes involved in the plant responses to drought stress. The forward (drought over drought-free) and reverse (drought-free over drought) suppression subtractive cDNA libraries were constructed using in vitro shoots of cultivar 'Zihonglong' exposed to drought stress and drought-free (control). A total of 2112 clones, among which half were from either forward or reverse SSH library, were randomly picked up to construct a pitaya cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis was carried out to verify the expression fluctuations of this set of clones upon drought treatment compared with the controls. A total of 309 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), 153 from forward library and 156 from reverse library, were obtained, and 138 unique ESTs were identified after sequencing by clustering and blast analyses, which included genes that had been previously reported as responsive to water stress as well as some functionally unknown genes. Thirty six genes were mapped to 47 KEGG pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and amino acid metabolism of pitaya. Expression analysis of the selected ESTs by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) corroborated the results of differential screening. Moreover, time-course expression patterns of these selected ESTs further confirmed that they were closely responsive to drought treatment. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), many are related to stress tolerances including drought tolerance. Thereby, the mechanism of drought tolerance of this pitaya genotype is a very complex physiological and biochemical process, in which multiple metabolism pathways and many genes were implicated. The data gained herein provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the drought stress tolerance of pitaya, as well as may facilitate the screening of candidate genes for drought tolerance. \n\u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate whether the methylation of miRNA genes regulates gene expression in bisexual flower development, the methylome, microRNA, and transcriptome were examined in female and male flowers of andromonoecious poplar. 27 636 methylated coding genes and 113 methylated miRNA genes were identified. In the coding genes, 64.5% of the methylated reads mapped to the gene body region; by contrast, 60.7% of methylated reads in miRNA genes mainly mapped in the 5' and 3' flanking regions. CHH methylation showed the highest methylation levels and CHG showed the lowest methylation levels. Correlation analysis showed a significant, negative, strand-specific correlation of methylation and miRNA gene expression (r=0.79, P <0.05). The methylated miRNA genes included eight long miRNAs (lmiRNAs) of 24 nucleotides and 11 miRNAs related to flower development. miRNA172b might play an important role in the regulation of bisexual flower development-related gene expression in andromonoecious poplar, via modification of methylation. Gynomonoecious, female, and male poplars were used to validate the methylation patterns of the miRNA172b gene, implying that hyper-methylation in andromonoecious and gynomonoecious poplar might function as an important regulator in bisexual flower development. Our data provide a useful resource for the study of flower development in poplar and improve our understanding of the effect of epigenetic regulation on genes other than protein-coding genes. \n\u00a9 The Author 2015.

However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic study regarding the expression pattern and the prognostic values of PTTG family genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains to be performed. The expression levels of PTTG family genes in NSCLC were successively determined using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, UALCAN and Oncomine databases. Subsequently, the Kaplan-Meier plotter database was used to assess the prognostic value of the PTTG family genes in patients with NSCLC, and to determine the associations between PTTG expression levels and the prognosis of patients based on different clinicopathological features, including cancer stage, grade, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, lymph node status, smoking history, and sex. PTTG1 was identified to be significantly upregulated in NSCLC in all three databases, whereas PTTG2 and PTTG3P were significantly upregulated in NSCLC in only the UALCAN database. Patients with NSCLC with higher expression levels of the three PTTG genes demonstrated shorter overall survival times. In summary, the results of the present study suggested that increased expression of PTTG family genes may serve as promising prognostic biomarkers for patients with NSCLC.\nCopyright: \u00a9 Yang et al.\n","801":"\nGenetic and environmental factors have been shown to work together to alter cancer risk. In this study we evaluate previously identified gene and lifestyle interactions in a candidate pathway that were associated with colon cancer risk to see if these interactions altered gene expression. We analyzed non-tumor RNA-seq data from 144 colon cancer patients who had genotype, recent cigarette smoking, diet, body mass index (BMI), and recent aspirin\/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use data. Using a false discovery rate of 0.1, we evaluated differential gene expression between high and low levels of lifestyle exposure and genotypes using DESeq2. Thirteen pathway genes and 17 SNPs within those genes were associated with altered expression of other genes in the pathway. BMI, NSAIDs use and dietary components of the oxidative balance score (OBS) also were associated with altered gene expression. SNPs previously identified as interacting with these lifestyle factors, altered expression of pathway genes. NSAIDs interacted with 10 genes (15 SNPs) within those genes to alter expression of 28 pathway genes; recent cigarette smoking interacted with seven genes (nine SNPs) to alter expression of 27 genes. BMI interacted with FLT1, KDR, SEPN1, TERT, TXNRD2, and VEGFA to alter expression of eight genes. Three genes (five SNPs) interacted with OBS to alter expression of 12 genes. These data provide support for previously identified lifestyle and gene interactions associated with colon cancer in that they altered expression of key pathway genes. The need to consider lifestyle factors in conjunction with genetic factors is illustrated. \n","802":"\nThe regulation of gene expression is essential for eukaryotes, as it drives the processes of cellular differentiation and morphogenesis, leading to the creation of different cell types in multicellular organisms. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides researchers with a powerful toolbox for characterization and quantification of transcriptome. Many different human tissue\/cell transcriptome datasets coming from RNA-Seq technology are available on public data resource. The fundamental issue here is how to develop an effective analysis method to estimate expression pattern similarities between different tumor tissues and their corresponding normal tissues. We define the gene expression pattern from three directions: 1) expression breadth, which reflects gene expression on\/off status, and mainly concerns ubiquitously expressed genes; 2) low\/high or constant\/variable expression genes, based on gene expression level and variation; and 3) the regulation of gene expression at the gene structure level. The cluster analysis indicates that gene expression pattern is higher related to physiological condition rather than tissue spatial distance. Two sets of human housekeeping (HK) genes are defined according to cell\/tissue types, respectively. To characterize the gene expression pattern in gene expression level and variation, we firstly apply improved K-means algorithm and a gene expression variance model. We find that cancer-associated HK genes (a HK gene is specific in cancer group, while not in normal group) are expressed higher and more variable in cancer condition than in normal condition. Cancer-associated HK genes prefer to AT-rich genes, and they are enriched in cell cycle regulation related functions and constitute some cancer signatures. The expression of large genes is also avoided in cancer group. These studies will help us understand which cell type-specific patterns of gene expression differ among different cell types, and particularly for cancer.\n","803":"\nInvestigations on a few eukaryotic model organisms showed that many genes are non-randomly distributed on chromosomes. In addition, chromosome ends frequently possess genes that are important for the fitness of the organisms. Trichoderma reesei is an industrial producer of enzymes for food, feed and biorefinery production. Its seven chromosomes have recently been assembled, thus making an investigation of its chromosome architecture possible.\nWe manually annotated and mapped 9194 ORFs on their respective chromosomes and investigated the clustering of the major gene categories and of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and the relationship between clustering and expression. Genes responsible for RNA processing and modification, amino acid metabolism, transcription, translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis indeed showed loose clustering, but this had no impact on their expression. A third of the genes encoding CAZymes also occurred in loose clusters that also contained a high number of genes encoding small secreted cysteine-rich proteins. Five CAZyme clusters were located less than 50\u00a0kb apart from the chromosome ends. These genes exhibited the lowest basal (but not induced) expression level, which correlated with an enrichment of H3K9 methylation in the terminal 50\u00a0kb areas indicating gene silencing. No differences were found in the expression of CAZyme genes present in other parts of the chromosomes. The putative subtelomeric areas were also enriched in genes encoding secreted proteases, amino acid permeases, enzyme clusters for polyketide synthases (PKS)-non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) fusion proteins (PKS-NRPS) and proteins involved in iron scavenging. They were strongly upregulated during conidiation and interaction with other fungi.\nOur findings suggest that gene clustering on the T. reesei chromosomes occurs but generally has no impact on their expression. CAZyme genes, located in subtelomers, however, exhibited a much lower basal expression level. The gene inventory of the subtelomers suggests a major role of competition for nitrogen and iron supported by antibiosis for the fitness of T. reesei. The availability of fully annotated chromosomes will facilitate the use of genetic crossings in identifying still unknown genes responsible for specific traits of T. reesei.\n","804":"\nThe morphological diversity of flower organs is closely related to functional divergence within the MADS-box gene family. Bryophytes and seedless vascular plants have MADS-box genes but do not have ABCDE or AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) genes. ABCDE and AGL6 genes belong to the subgroup of MADS-box genes. Previous works suggest that the B gene was the first ABCDE and AGL6 genes to emerge in plant but there are no mentions about the probable origin time of ACDE and AGL6 genes. Here, we collected ABCDE and AGL6 gene 381 protein sequences and 361 coding sequences from gymnosperms and angiosperms and reconstructed a complete Bayesian phylogeny of these genes. In this study, we want to clarify the probable origin time of ABCDE and AGL6 genes is a great help for understanding the role of the formation of the flower, which can decipher the forming order of MADS-box genes in the future.\nThese genes appeared to have been under purifying selection and their evolutionary rates are not significantly different from each other. Using the Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST) tool, we estimated that: the mutation rate of the ABCDE and AGL6 genes was 2.617\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3 substitutions\/site\/million years, and that B genes originated 339 million years ago (MYA), CD genes originated 322 MYA, and A genes shared the most recent common ancestor with E\/AGL6 296 MYA, respectively.\nThe phylogeny of ABCDE and AGL6 genes subfamilies differed. The APETALA1 (AP1 or A gene) subfamily clustered into one group. The APETALA3\/PISTILLATA (AP3\/PI or B genes) subfamily clustered into two groups: the AP3 and PI clades. The AGAMOUS\/SHATTERPROOF\/SEEDSTICK (AG\/SHP\/STK or CD genes) subfamily clustered into a single group. The SEPALLATA (SEP or E gene) subfamily in angiosperms clustered into two groups: the SEP1\/2\/4 and SEP3 clades. The AGL6 subfamily clustered into a single group.

For quantifying changes in gene expression in vector aphids, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a touchstone method, but the selection and validation of housekeeping genes (HKGs) as reference genes to normalize the expression level of endogenous genes of the vector and for exogenous genes of the virus in the aphids is critical to obtaining valid results. Such an assessment has not been done, however, for R. padi and YDVs. Here, we tested three algorithms (GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) to assess the suitability of candidate reference genes (EF-1\u03b1, ACT1, GAPDH, 18S rRNA) in 6 combinations of YDV and vector aphid morph. EF-1\u03b1 and ACT1 together or in combination with GAPDH or with GAPDH and 18S rRNA could confidently be used to normalize virus titre and expression levels of endogenous genes in winged or wingless R. padi infected with Barley yellow dwarf virus isolates (BYDV)-PAV and BYDV-GAV. The use of only one reference gene, whether the most stably expressed (EF-1\u03b1) or the least stably expressed (18S rRNA), was not adequate for obtaining valid relative expression data from the RT-qPCR. Because of discrepancies among values for changes in relative expression obtained using 3 regions of the same gene, different regions of an endogenous aphid gene, including each terminus and the middle, should be analyzed at the same time with RT-qPCR. Our results highlight the necessity of choosing the best reference genes to obtain valid experimental data and provide several HKGs for relative quantification of virus titre in YDV-viruliferous aphids. \n","806":"\nThe compound 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxy stilbene-2-O-\u00df-d-glucoside (THSG) synthesized by Fallopia multiflora (F. multiflora) exhibits pharmacological potency. However, the mechanistic details of its biosynthesis pathway are still vague. To clear this ambiguity, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and digital gene expression (DGE) profiling analyses of F. multiflora using the Illumina RNA-seq system. RNA-seq generated approximately 70 million high-quality reads that were assembled into 65,653 unigenes (mean length=750 bp), including 26,670 clusters and 38,983 singletons. A total of 48,173 (73.4%) unigenes were annotated using public protein databases with a cut-off e-value above 10(-5). Furthermore, we investigated the transcriptome difference of four different F. multiflora tissues using DGE profiling. Variations in gene expression were identified based on comparisons of transcriptomes from various parts of a high-level THSG- and a low-level THSG-producing F. multiflora plant. Clusters with similar differential expression patterns and enriched metabolic pathways with regard to the differentially expressed genes putatively involved in THSG biosynthesis were revealed for the first time.

In this study, the stability of nine housekeeping genes of the sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Mediterranean were evaluated in various conditions by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using geNorm and Normfinder programs. Both programs suggested alpha-tubulin\/ubiquitin and 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA the most stable genes for bacterium- and insecticide-treated whiteflies, respectively. For developmental stages, organs, and the samples including salivary glands and the whole body, transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit was calculated as the most stably expressed gene by both programs. In addition, we compared the RNA-seq data with the results of geNorm and Normfinder and found that the stable genes revealed by RNA-seq analysis were also the ERGs recommended by geNorm and Normfinder. Furthermore, the use of the most stable gene suggested by RNA-seq analysis as an ERG produced similar gene expression patterns compared with results generated from the normalization against the most stable gene selected by geNorm and Normfinder and multiple genes recommended by geNorm. It indicates that RNA-seq data are reliable and provide a great source for ERG candidate exploration. Our results benefit future research on gene expression profiles of whiteflies and possibly other organisms.\n","808":"\nMany microbes acquire metabolites in a \"feeding\" process where complex polymers are broken down in the environment to their subunits. The subsequent uptake of soluble metabolites by a cell, sometimes called osmotrophy, is facilitated by transporter proteins. As such, the diversification of osmotrophic microorganisms is closely tied to the diversification of transporter functions. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has been suggested to produce genetic variation that can lead to adaptation, allowing lineages to acquire traits and expand niche ranges. Transporter genes often encode single-gene phenotypes and tend to have low protein-protein interaction complexity and, as such, are potential candidates for HGT. Here we test the idea that HGT has underpinned the expansion of metabolic potential and substrate utilization via transfer of transporter-encoding genes. Using phylogenomics, we identify seven cases of transporter-gene HGT between fungal phyla, and investigate compatibility, localization, function, and fitness consequences when these genes are expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Using this approach, we demonstrate that the transporters identified can alter how fungi utilize a range of metabolites, including peptides, polyols, and sugars. We then show, for one model gene, that transporter gene acquisition by HGT can significantly alter the fitness landscape of S. cerevisiae We therefore provide evidence that transporter HGT occurs between fungi, alters how fungi can acquire metabolites, and can drive gain in fitness. We propose a \"transporter-gene acquisition ratchet,\" where transporter repertoires are continually augmented by duplication, HGT, and differential loss, collectively acting to overwrite, fine-tune, and diversify the complement of transporters present in a genome.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 the Author(s).

One example is the Bmp16 gene, a paralog of the developmental key genes Bmp2 and -4. We focus on the Bmp2\/4\/16 group of genes to study the evolutionary dynamics following gen(om)e duplications with special emphasis on the poorly studied Bmp16 gene. We reveal the presence of Bmp16 in chondrichthyans in addition to previously reported teleost fishes and reptiles. Using comprehensive, vertebrate-wide gene sampling, our phylogenetic analysis complemented with synteny analyses suggests that Bmp2, -4 and -16 are remnants of a gene quartet that originated during the two rounds of whole-genome duplication (2R-WGD) early in vertebrate evolution. We confirm that Bmp16 genes were lost independently in at least three lineages (mammals, archelosaurs and amphibians) and report that they have elevated rates of sequence evolution. This finding agrees with their more \"flexible\" deployment during development; while Bmp16 has limited embryonic expression domains in the cloudy catshark, it is broadly expressed in the green anole lizard. Our study illustrates the dynamics of gene family evolution by integrating insights from sequence diversification, gene repertoire changes, and shuffling of expression domains.\n","810":"\nGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of genetic loci associated with cardiometabolic traits including type 2 diabetes (T2D), lipid levels, body fat distribution, and adiposity, although most causal genes remain unknown. We used subcutaneous adipose tissue RNA-seq data from 434 Finnish men from the METSIM study to identify 9,687 primary and 2,785 secondary cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL; <1 Mb from TSS, FDR < 1%). Compared to primary eQTL signals, secondary eQTL signals were located further from transcription start sites, had smaller effect sizes, and were less enriched in adipose tissue regulatory elements compared to primary signals. Among 2,843 cardiometabolic GWAS signals, 262 colocalized by LD and conditional analysis with 318 transcripts as primary and conditionally distinct secondary cis-eQTLs, including some across ancestries. Of cardiometabolic traits examined for adipose tissue eQTL colocalizations, waist-hip ratio (WHR) and circulating lipid traits had the highest percentage of colocalized eQTLs (15% and 14%, respectively). Among alleles associated with increased cardiometabolic GWAS risk, approximately half (53%) were associated with decreased gene expression level. Mediation analyses of colocalized genes and cardiometabolic traits within the 434 individuals provided further evidence that gene expression influences variant-trait associations. These results identify hundreds of candidate genes that may act in adipose tissue to influence cardiometabolic traits.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

However, little information is available regarding the WRKY family in Eucalyptus, which has been the most widely planted hardwood trees in tropical and subtropical areas. In this study, a total of 79 WRKY genes (named as EgrWRKY1-79) were identified from the Eucalyptus grandis genome and classified into three main groups according to the phylogenetic analysis, which was further supported by their gene structure and conserved motifs. Of which, 28 EgrWRKYs were involved in tandem duplication but none for segmental duplication, indicating that tandem duplication was the main cause for the expansion of WRKY gene family in E. grandis. Subsequently, expression profiles of EgrWRKY genes in eight different tissues and in response to treatments of three hormones (SA, JA, and BR) and two abiotic stresses (salt and cold) were analyzed. The results revealed that the EgrWRKY genes had differential expression in their transcript abundance and they were differentially expressed in response to plant hormones and salt and cold stresses, suggesting their contributions to plant developmental processes as well as abiotic stresses with the involvement of hormone signaling transduction. Taken together, these findings will increase our understanding of EgrWRKY gene family involved in abiotic stresses and hormone signaling transduction, and also will provide some stress-responsive candidate EgrWRKY genes for further characterization of their functions in Eucalyptus.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018.

Therefore, we performed a genome-wide sequence analysis of T1D candidate genes to identify embedded Alu elements within these genes. We observed significant enrichment of Alu elements within the T1D genes (p-value < 10e-16), which highlights their importance in T1D. Functional annotation of T1D genes harboring Alus revealed significant enrichment for immune-mediated processes (p-value < 10e-6). We also identified eight T1D genes harboring inverted Alus (IRAlus) within their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that are known to regulate the expression of host mRNAs by generating double stranded RNA duplexes. Our in silico analysis predicted the formation of duplex structures by IRAlus within the 3'UTRs of T1D genes. We propose that IRAlus might be involved in regulating the expression levels of the host T1D genes. \n","813":"\nIdentification of marker genes associated with a specific tissue\/cell type is a fundamental challenge in genetic and cell research. Marker genes are of great importance for determining cell identity, and for understanding tissue specific gene function and the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases.\nWe have developed a new bioinformatics tool called MGFM (Marker Gene Finder in Microarray data) to predict marker genes from microarray gene expression data. Marker genes are identified through the grouping of samples of the same type with similar marker gene expression levels. We verified our approach using two microarray data sets from the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus public repository encompassing samples for similar sets of five human tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung). Comparison with another tool for tissue-specific gene identification and validation with literature-derived established tissue markers established functionality, accuracy and simplicity of our tool. Furthermore, top ranked marker genes were experimentally validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sets of predicted marker genes associated with the five selected tissues comprised well-known genes of particular importance in these tissues. The tool is freely available from the Bioconductor web site, and it is also provided as an online application integrated into the CellFinder platform ( http:\/\/cellfinder.org\/analysis\/marker ).\nMGFM is a useful tool to predict tissue\/cell type marker genes using microarray gene expression data. The implementation of the tool as an R-package as well as an application within CellFinder facilitates its use.\n","814":"\nAntibiotics are commonly used in swine feed to treat and prevent disease, as well as to promote growth. Antibiotics released into the environment via wastewater could accelerate the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes in the surrounding environment. In this study, we quantified the occurrence of sulfonamides, sulfonamide-resistant microorganisms and resistance genes in the wastewater from a swine farm in northern Taiwan and its surrounding natural water bodies and soils. Sulfonamide levels were similar in the receiving downstream and upstream river water. However, the prevalence of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, as analyzed by cultivation-dependent and -independent molecular approaches, was significantly greater in the downstream compared to the upstream river water samples. Barcoded-pyrosequencing revealed a highly diverse bacterial community structure in each sample. However, the sequence identity of the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in the wastewater and downstream environment samples was nearly identical (99-100%). The sul1 gene, which is genetically linked to class 1 integrons, was dominant in the downstream water bodies and soils. In conclusion, the increased prevalence of sulfonamide resistance genes in the wastewater from a swine farm, independent of the persistent presence of sulfonamides, could be a potential source of resistant gene pools in the surrounding environment. \nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aimed to identify a novel methylation-based prognosis biomarker panel by integrally analyzing gene expression and methylation patterns in BC patients.\nDNA methylation and gene expression data of breast cancer (BRCA) were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). R packages, including ChAMP, SVA, and MethylMix, were applied to identify the unique methylation-driven genes. Subsequently, these genes were subjected to Metascape for GO analysis. Univariant Cox regression was used to identify survival-related genes among the methylation-driven genes. Robust likelihood-based survival modeling was applied to define the prognosis markers. An independent data set (GSE72308) was used for further validation of our risk score system.\nA total of 879 DNA methylation-driven genes were identified from 765 BC patients. In the discovery cohort, we identified 50 survival-related methylation-driven genes. Finally, we built an eight-methylation-driven gene panel that serves as prognostic predictors.\nOur analysis of transcriptome and methylome variations associated with the survival status of BC patients provides a further understanding of basic biological processes and a basis for the genetic etiology in BC.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Kuang, Wang, Zhai, Wang, Zhang, Xu, Guo, Ke, Jia and Liu.\n","816":"\nDriver genes are directly responsible for oncogenesis and identifying them is essential in order to fully understand the mechanisms of cancer. However, it is difficult to delineate them from the larger pool of genes that are deregulated in cancer (ie, passenger genes). In order to address this problem, we developed an approach called TRIAngulating Gene Expression (TRIAGE through clinico-genomic intersects). Here, we present a refinement of this approach incorporating a new scoring methodology to identify putative driver genes that are deregulated in cancer. TRIAGE triangulates - or integrates - three levels of information: gene expression, gene location, and patient survival. First, TRIAGE identifies regions of deregulated expression (ie, expression footprints) by deriving a newly established measure called the Local Singular Value Decomposition (LSVD) score for each locus. Driver genes are then distinguished from passenger genes using dual survival analyses. Incorporating measurements of gene expression and weighting them according to the LSVD weight of each tumor, these analyses are performed using the genes located in significant expression footprints. Here, we first use simulated data to characterize the newly established LSVD score. We then present the results of our application of this refined version of TRIAGE to gene expression data from five cancer types. This refined version of TRIAGE not only allowed us to identify known prominent driver genes, such as MMP1, IL8, and COL1A2, but it also led us to identify several novel ones. These results illustrate that TRIAGE complements existing tools, allows for the identification of genes that drive cancer and could perhaps elucidate potential future targets of novel anticancer therapeutics. \n","817":"\nAlbinism is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder due to low secretion of melanin. The oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and ocular albinism (OA) genes are responsible for melanin production and also act as a potential targets for miRNAs. The role of miRNA is to inhibit the protein synthesis partially or completely by binding with the 3'UTR of the mRNA thus regulating gene expression. In this analysis, we predicted the genetic variation that occurred in 3'UTR of the transcript which can be a reason for low melanin production thus causing albinism. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3'UTR cause more new binding sites for miRNA which binds with mRNA which leads to inhibit the translation process either partially or completely. The SNPs in the mRNA of OCA and OA genes can create new binding sites for miRNA which may control the gene expression and lead to hypopigmentation. We have developed a computational procedure to determine the SNPs in the 3'UTR region of mRNA of OCA (TYR, OCA2, TYRP1 and SLC45A2) and OA (GPR143) genes which will be a potential cause for albinism. We identified 37 SNPs in five genes that are predicted to create 87 new binding sites on mRNA, which may lead to abrogation of the translation process. Expression analysis confirms that these genes are highly expressed in skin and eye regions. It is well supported by enrichment analysis that these genes are mainly involved in eye pigmentation and melanin biosynthesis process. The network analysis also shows how the genes are interacting and expressing in a complex network. This insight provides clue to wet-lab researches to understand the expression pattern of OCA and OA genes and binding phenomenon of mRNA and miRNA upon mutation, which is responsible for inhibition of translation process at genomic levels.\n","818":"\nThe gene transactivation function of nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) has been studied by investigating the genomic co-occupancies of nEGFR and RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII). However, due to RNAPII pausing, the co-recruitment of RNAPII and nEGFR does not necessarily represent productive transactivation. In this study, we integrated gatekeepers of productive transcriptional elongation such as Integrator and Super Elongation Complex (SEC) to interrogate the function of nEGFR. By analyzing publicly available ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, we aims to 1) explore the function of nEGFR, 2) unravel nEGFR target genes, and 3) discuss potential mechanisms of nEGFR chromatin recruitment. EGF treatment in HeLa cells instigated chromatin recruitment of nEGFR, ERK, RNAPII, Integrator, and SEC in a cluster of 61 EGF-responsive genes. The function of nEGFR was identified as gene-activating rather than gene-repressing. Within the cluster of EGF-responsive genes, nEGFR targeted eleven Immediate Early Genes (IEGs) - JUN, EGR1, JUNB, IER2, KLF2, FOS, FOSL1, RHOB, CCNL1, DUSP2, and DUSP5, which up-regulated >2-fold after EGF stimulation. The promoter of these target genes commonly harbors AT-rich minimal consensus sequences for nEGFR binding. In addition, TCGA data analysis demonstrated positive correlations between EGFR and JUN\/FOSL1\/RHOB expressions, as well as clinical correlations in specific cancer types. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the genome-wide distribution of nEGFR versus Integrator and SEC, providing novel insight into supporting the gene-activating function of nEGFR. We revealed a panel of eleven nEGFR target genes, which concurrently recruited nEGFR, RNAPII, Integrator, and SEC for productive transcriptional elongation.\n","819":"\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special subtype of breast cancer (BC) with poor prognosis. Although some molecular mechanisms of TNBC have been elucidated, the efficacy of current treatments is limited. Therefore, it is urgently demanded to screen for novel biomarkers and drug targets for TNBC. In this study, we obtained four independent data sets (GSE76250, GSE31448, GSE43358, and METABRIC) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the cBioPortal website. In the GSE76250 data set, 890 differentially expressed genes were identified and weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed based on them. Then, two preserved modules associated with the KI67 score were detected. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses showed genes in the modules participated in some cancer-related biological processes or pathways. Non-SMC condensin I complex subunit G (NCAPG) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 9 (ABCA9) were identified as hub genes of the modules, and the significance of hub genes was validated in the GSE43358 data set. Finally, their prognostic value was assessed by survival analysis. These findings suggested that NCAPG and ABCA9 may be the key genes of TNBC. Moreover, ABCA9 was first reported in TNBC. They deserved further studies.\n\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","820":"\nMucosal expression of immunological mediators is modified in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Quantification of target gene messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts depends on the normalization to a housekeeping or reference gene. Stability of housekeeping gene expression is critical for the accurate measurement of transcripts of the target gene. No studies have addressed the optimization of reference gene performance for mRNA studies in healthy intestinal mucosa and during mucosal inflammation.\nRNA was extracted from endoscopically obtained intestinal biopsies from healthy control subjects and patients with active IBD or non-IBD inflammatory diseases. Comparative analysis of 10 candidate housekeeping genes for quantitative real-time PCR was carried out according to predefined criteria, including use of the Web-based RefFinder platform.\nWe demonstrate that intestinal inflammation may significantly affect the stability of mucosal expression of housekeeping genes. Commonly used controls, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, \u03b2-actin, or \u03b22-microglobulin displayed high variability within the control group and\/or between the healthy and inflamed mucosae. In contrast, we have identified novel genes with optimal stability, which may be used as appropriate housekeeping controls. The ribosomal proteins encoding genes (RPLPO and RPS9) were the most stable because their expression was not affected by interindividual differences, the presence of inflammation, or intestinal location. Normalization ofthe mRNA expression of mucosal tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 was highly dependent on the specific reference gene and varied significantly when normalized to genes with high or low stability.\nValidation for optimal performance of the housekeeping gene is required for target mRNA quantification in healthy intestine and IBD-associated lesions. Suboptimal reference gene expression may explain conflicting results from published studies on IBD gene expression.\n","821":"\nIn humans, despite the rapid increase in disease-associated gene discovery, a large proportion of disease-associated genes are still unknown. Many network-based approaches have been used to prioritize disease genes. Many networks, such as the protein-protein interaction (PPI), KEGG, and gene co-expression networks, have been used. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been successfully applied for the determination of genes associated with several diseases. In this study, we constructed an eQTL-based gene-gene co-regulation network (GGCRN) and used it to mine for disease genes. We adopted the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm to mine for genes associated with Alzheimer disease. Compared to the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) PPI network alone, the integrated HPRD PPI and GGCRN networks provided faster convergence and revealed new disease-related genes. Therefore, using the RWR algorithm for integrated PPI and GGCRN is an effective method for disease-associated gene mining. \n","822":"\nPrevious gene expression profiling studies of neuropathic pain (NP) following spinal cord injury (SCI) have predominantly been performed in animal models. The present study aimed to investigate gene alterations in patients with spinal cord injury and to further examine the mechanisms underlying NP following SCI. The GSE69901 gene expression profile was downloaded from the public Gene Expression Omnibus database. Samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 12\u00a0patients with intractable NP and 13 control patients without pain were analyzed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by functional enrichment analysis and protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) network construction. In addition, a transcriptional regulation network was constructed and functional gene clustering was performed. A total of 70 upregulated and 61 downregulated DEGs were identified in the PBMC samples from patients with NP. The upregulated and downregulated genes were significantly involved in different Gene Ontology terms and pathways, including focal adhesion, T cell receptor signaling pathway and mitochondrial function. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 \u03b2 (GSK3B) was identified as a hub protein in the PPI network. In addition, ornithine decarboxylase\u00a01 (ODC1) and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) were regulated by additional transcription factors in the regulation network. GSK3B, OAT and ODC1 were significantly enriched in two functional gene clusters, the function of mitochondrial membrane and DNA binding. Focal adhesion and the T cell receptor signaling pathway may be significantly linked with NP, and GSK3B, OAT and ODC1 may be potential targets for the treatment of NP.\n","823":"\nNetwork study on genes and proteins offers functional basics of the complexity of gene and protein, and its interacting partners. The gene fatty acid-binding protein 4 (fabp4) is found to be highly expressed in adipose tissue, and is one of the most abundant proteins in mature adipocytes. Our investigations on functional modules of fabp4 provide useful information on the functional genes interacting with fabp4, their biochemical properties and their regulatory functions. The present study shows that there are eight set of candidate genes: acp1, ext2, insr, lipe, ostf1, sncg, usp15, and vim that are strongly and functionally linked up with fabp4. Gene ontological analysis of network modules of fabp4 provides an explicit idea on the functional aspect of fabp4 and its interacting nodes. The hierarchal mapping on gene ontology indicates gene specific processes and functions as well as their compartmentalization in tissues. The fabp4 along with its interacting genes are involved in lipid metabolic activity and are integrated in multi-cellular processes of tissues and organs. They also have important protein\/enzyme binding activity. Our study elucidated disease-associated nsSNP prediction for fabp4 and it is interesting to note that there are four rsID\u05f3s (rs1051231, rs3204631, rs140925685 and rs141169989) with disease allelic variation (T104P, T126P, G27D and G90V respectively).

Meanwhile, its most common manifestation is pulmonary sarcoidosis. This study aimed to identify effective biomarkers for the diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary sarcoidosis.\nGSE16538 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including 6 pulmonary sarcoidosis samples and 6 normal lung samples. Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by limma package in R. After the expression values of the DEGs were extracted, hierarchical clustering analysis was performed for the DEGs using the pheatmap package in R. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs among the DEGs were searched by STRING or REACTOME databases, and then PPI networks were visualized by Cytoscape software. Using DAVID and KOBAS, functional and pathway enrichment analyses separately were performed for the DEGs involved in the PPI network.\nTotal 208 DEGs were identified in pulmonary sarcoidosis samples, including 179 up-regulated genes and 29 down-regulated genes. Hierarchical clustering showed that the DEGs could clearly distinguish the pulmonary sarcoidosis samples from the normal lung samples. In the PPI network constructed by STRING database, CXCL9, STAT1, CCL5, CXCL11 and GBP1 had higher degrees and betweenness values, and could interact with each other. Functional enrichment showed that CXCL9, CXCL11 and CCL5 were enriched in immune response. Moreover, STAT1 was enriched in pathways of chemokine signaling pathway and JAK-STAT signaling pathway.\nCXCL9, CXCL11, STAT1, CCL5 and GBP1 might be implicated in pulmonary sarcoidosis through interacting with each other.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Even though there are many valuable studies on B3 genes in other species, little is known about the B3 superfamily in tobacco. We identified 114 B3 proteins from tobacco using comparative genome analysis. These proteins were classified into four subfamilies based on their phylogenetic relationships, and include the ARF, RAV, LAV, and REM subfamilies. The chromosomal locations, gene structures, conserved protein motifs, and sub-cellular localizations of the tobacco B3 proteins were analyzed. The patterns of exon-intron numbers and arrangement and the protein structures of the tobacco B3 proteins were in general agreement with their phylogenetic relationships. The expression patterns of 114 B3 genes revealed that many B3 genes show tissue-specific expression. The expression levels of B3 genes in axillary buds after topping showed that the REM genes are mainly up-regulated in response to topping, while the ARF genes are down-regulated after topping.\n","826":"\nLactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium that can degrade food tannins by the successive action of tannase and gallate decarboxylase enzymes. In the L. plantarum genome, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of gallate decarboxylase (lpdC, or lp_2945) is only 6.5 kb distant from the gene encoding inducible tannase (L. plantarumtanB [tanBLp ], or lp_2956). This genomic context suggests concomitant activity and regulation of both enzymatic activities. Reverse transcription analysis revealed that subunits B (lpdB, or lp_0271) and D (lpdD, or lp_0272) of the gallate decarboxylase are cotranscribed, whereas subunit C (lpdC, or lp_2945) is cotranscribed with a gene encoding a transport protein (gacP, or lp_2943). In contrast, the tannase gene is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA. Investigation of knockout mutations of genes located in this chromosomal region indicated that only mutants of the gallate decarboxylase (subunits B and C), tannase, GacP transport protein, and TanR transcriptional regulator (lp_2942) genes exhibited altered tannin metabolism. The expression profile of genes involved in tannin metabolism was also analyzed in these mutants in the presence of methyl gallate and gallic acid. It is noteworthy that inactivation of tanR suppresses the induction of all genes overexpressed in the presence of methyl gallate and gallic acid. This transcriptional regulator was also induced in the presence of other phenolic compounds, such as kaempferol and myricetin. This study complements the catalog of L. plantarum expression profiles responsive to phenolic compounds, which enable this bacterium to adapt to a plant food environment.IMPORTANCELactobacillus plantarum is a bacterial species frequently found in the fermentation of vegetables when tannins are present. L. plantarum strains degrade tannins to the less-toxic pyrogallol by the successive action of tannase and gallate decarboxylase enzymes. The genes encoding these enzymes are located close to each other in the chromosome, suggesting concomitant regulation. Proteins involved in tannin metabolism and regulation, such GacP (gallic acid permease) and TanR (tannin transcriptional regulator), were identified by differential gene expression in knockout mutants with mutations in genes from this region. This study provides insights into the highly coordinated mechanisms that enable L. plantarum to adapt to plant food fermentations.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 American Society for Microbiology.\n","827":"\nNormalization is an essential prerequisite for producing accurate real-time PCR expression analyses. The objective of this study is the selection of a set of optimal reference genes in Bifidobacterium adolescentis gene expression studies under bile exposure. B adolescentis is a particularly abundant species in the human adults gut microbiota, exerting relevant probiotic activities. In the gastrointestinal tract, bile represents a hard challenge for bacterial survival, because of its toxic effect. The natural exposure to bile in the colonic environment induces cells adaptation and tolerance mechanisms in bifidobacteria, which determines changes in gene expression profile, influencing the expression levels of housekeeping genes. In this context, the stability of 9 putative reference genes (cysS, purB, recA, rpoB-L, GADPH-R, 16S rRNA, glnA1, gyrA2, sdhA) was examined in B.\u00a0adolescentis exposed to bile extract, using two different software (BestKeeper and NormFinder). Both algorithms identified gyrA2 and sdhA as the most stable genes under our experimental conditions, while 16S rRNA is the least reliable HKGs. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to validate reference genes in Bifidobacterium spp. and the results offer an appropriate set of reference genes suitable for qRT-PCR studies on B. adolescentis strains under bile stress. \nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of in utero BPA exposure on gene expression in the anterior hypothalamus, the basal nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and hippocampus in C57BL\/6 mice. Mice were exposed in utero to human-relevant doses of BPA, and then RNA sequencing was performed on male PND 28 tissue from whole hypothalamus (n = 3\/group) that included the medial preoptic area (mPOA) and BNST to determine whether any genes were differentially expressed between BPA-exposed and control mice. A subset of genes was selected for further study using RT-qPCR on adult tissue from hippocampus to determine whether any differentially expressed genes (DEGs) persisted into adulthood. Two different RNA-Seq workflows indicated a total of 259 genes that were differentially expressed between BPA-exposed and control mice. Gene ontology analysis indicated that those DEGs were overrepresented in categories relating to mating, cell-cell signaling, behavior, neurodevelopment, neurogenesis, synapse formation, cognition, learning behaviors, hormone activity, and signaling receptor activity, among others. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to interrogate novel gene networks and upstream regulators, indicating the top five upstream regulators as huntingtin, beta-estradiol, alpha-synuclein, Creb1, and estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha. In addition, 15 DE genes were identified that are suspected in autism spectrum disorders.\n","829":"\nIdentification of master regulatory genes is one of the primary challenges in systems biology. The minimum dominating set problem is a powerful paradigm in analyzing such complex networks. In these models, genes stand as nodes and their interactions are assumed as edges. Here, members of a minimal dominating set could be regarded as master genes. As finitely many minimum dominating sets may exist in a network, it is difficult to identify which one represents the most appropriate set of master genes. In this paper, we develop a weighted gene regulatory network problem with two objectives as a version of the dominating set problem. Collective influence of each gene is considered as its weight. The first objective aims to find a master regulatory genes set with minimum cardinality, and the second objective identifies the one with maximum weight. The model is converted to a single objective using a parameter varying between zero and one. The model is implemented on three human networks, and the results are reported and compared with the existing model of weighted network. Parametric programming in linear optimization and logistic regression are also implemented on the arisen relaxed problem to provide a deeper understanding of the results. Learned from computational results in parametric analysis, for some ranges of priorities in objectives, the identified master regulatory genes are invariant, while some of them are identified for all priorities. This would be an indication that such genes have higher degree of being master regulatory ones, specially on the noisy networks.\n","830":"\nGenes encoding casein proteins are important candidates for milk composition traits in mammals.

This study involved screening for polymorphism in 5'-flanking regions of four genes encoding equine caseins (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, CSN2, and CSN3) and making a preliminary assessment of their effect on the gene expression (on the mRNA and protein levels) and milk composition traits in selected horse breeds. Altogether, 23 polymorphisms (21 described previously SNPs and two novel InDels) were found in the studied sequences, the majority of which are common in various horse breeds. Statistical analysis revealed that some are putatively associated with gene expression or milk composition\u00a0-\u00a0for example, the c.-2047_-2048insAT polymorphism (CSN1S1) turns out to be related to the total milk protein content in Polish Primitive Horse\u00a0(p\u2009<\u20090.05), whereas c.-2105C>G SNP (CSN2) is related to beta-casein relative mRNA level and milk lactose concentration in the Polish Coldblood Horse breed (p\u2009<\u20090.05). We have also found significant effects of horse breed and lactation time-point on gene expression and mare's milk composition. Our study indicates that the 5'-regulatory regions of genes encoding casein proteins are interesting targets for functional studies of their expression and the composition traits of mare's milk.\n","831":"\nPlant resistance conferred by nucleotide binding site (NBS)-encoding resistance genes plays a key role in the defense against various pathogens throughout the entire plant life cycle. However, comparative analyses for the systematic evaluation and determination of the evolutionary modes of NBS-encoding genes among Solanaceae species are rare. In this study, 447, 255, and 306 NBS-encoding genes were identified from the genomes of potato, tomato, and pepper, respectively. These genes usually clustered as tandem arrays on chromosomes; few existed as singletons. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that three subclasses [TNLs (TIR-NBS-LRR), CNLs (CC-NBS-LRR), and RNLs (RPW8-NBS-LRR)] each formed a monophyletic clade and were distinguished by unique exon\/intron structures and amino acid motif sequences. By comparing phylogenetic and systematic relationships, we inferred that the NBS-encoding genes in the present genomes of potato, tomato, and pepper were derived from 150 CNL, 22 TNL, and 4 RNL ancestral genes, and underwent independent gene loss and duplication events after speciation. The NBS-encoding genes therefore exhibit diverse and dynamic evolutionary patterns in the three Solanaceae species, giving rise to the discrepant gene numbers observed today. Potato shows a \"consistent expansion\" pattern, tomato exhibits a pattern of \"first expansion and then contraction,\" and pepper presents a \"shrinking\" pattern. The earlier expansion of CNLs in the common ancestor led to the dominance of this subclass in gene numbers. However, RNLs remained at low copy numbers due to their specific functions. Along the evolutionary process of NBS-encoding genes in Solanaceae, species-specific tandem duplications contributed the most to gene expansions.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Qian et al.\n","832":"\nPolycomb Group (PcG) genes are transcriptional repressors that are described to be important during development and differentiation. There is significant interest in PcGs proteins because of their role in stem cell biology and tumorigenesis. In this study we characterize the expression of a selection of PcG genes in the adult germline of zebrafish and during embryogenesis. In adults, expression of selected PcG genes is found to be enriched in germ line over somatic tissues. Therefore, the germ line of adult zebrafish was analyzed for the expression pattern of a selection of PcG genes by whole mount in situ hybridization. We detected presence of the tested PcG gene transcripts at early stages of both oogenesis and spermatogenesis. This enriched expression for early stages of gametogenesis is also observed in developing gonads at 4 and 5 weeks post fertilization. Additionally, zebrafish embryos were used to study the spatio-temporal expression patterns of a selection of PcG genes during development. The PcG genes that we tested are maternally loaded and ubiquitously expressed at early developmental stages, except of ezh1. The expression of the PcG genes that were assessed becomes enriched anteriorly and is more defined during tissue specification. The data shown here is an important resource for functional PcG gene studies in vivo.\n","833":"\nPseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two evolutionary distant bacterial species that are frequently isolated from persistent infections such as chronic infectious wounds and severe lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. To the best of our knowledge no comprehensive genome scale co-expression study has been already conducted on these two species and in most cases only the expression of very few genes has been the subject of investigation. In this study, in order to investigate the level of expressional conservation between these two species, using heterogeneous gene expression datasets the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) approach was applied to study both single and cross species genome scale co-expression patterns of these two species. Single species co-expression network analysis revealed that in P. aeruginosa, genes involved in quorum sensing (QS), iron uptake, nitrate respiration and type III secretion systems and in S. aureus, genes associated with the regulation of carbon metabolism, fatty acid-phospholipids metabolism and proteolysis represent considerable co-expression across a variety of experimental conditions. Moreover, the comparison of gene co-expression networks between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was led to the identification of four co-expressed gene modules in both species totally consisting of 318 genes. Several genes related to two component signal transduction systems, small colony variants (SCVs) morphotype and protein complexes were found in the detected modules. We believe that targeting the key players among the identified co-expressed orthologous genes will be a potential intervention strategy to control refractory co-infections caused by these two bacterial species.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We uncover here a family of antisense RNAs, named START RNAs, produced during cellular senescence by transcriptional read-through at convergent protein-coding genes. Importantly, START RNAs repress the expression of their corresponding sense RNAs. In proliferative cells, we found that the Pol II elongation rate is limited downstream of TTS at START loci, allowing transcription termination to occur before Pol II reaches the convergent genes, thus preventing antisense RNA production and interference with the expression of the convergent genes. START RNAs are repressed by H2A.Z histone variant, whose local occupancy decreases in senescence. Our results thus uncover a mechanism of gene expression regulation relying on read-through antisense transcript production at convergent genes, underlining the functional importance of chromatin regulation in the control of RNA pol II elongation rate at intergenic regions.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

To date, there have been no studies investigating gene number, gene features, or gene expression patterns of orphan genes in Brassica rapa. In this study, 1540 Brassica-specific genes (BSGs) and 1824 Cruciferae-specific genes (CSGs) were identified based on the genome of Brassica rapa. The genic features analysis indicated that BSGs and CSGs possessed a lower percentage of multi-exon genes, higher GC content, and shorter gene length than evolutionary-conserved genes (ECGs). In addition, five types of BSGs were obtained and 145 out of 529 real A subgenome-specific BSGs were verified by PCR in 51 species. In silico and semi-qPCR, gene expression analysis of BSGs suggested that BSGs are expressed in various tissue and can be induced by Plasmodiophora brassicae. Moreover, an A\/C subgenome-specific BSG, BSGs1, was specifically expressed during the heading stage, indicating that the gene might be associated with leafy head formation. Our results provide valuable biological information for studying the molecular function of BSGs for Brassica-specific phenotypes and biotic stress in B. rapa.\n","836":"\nThe non-conventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is able to utilize a wide range of different substrates like glucose, glycerol, ethanol, acetate, proteins and various hydrophobic molecules. Although most metabolic pathways for the utilization of these substrates have been clarified by now, it was not clear whether ethanol is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenases or by an alternative oxidation system inside the cell. In order to detect the genes that are required for ethanol utilization in Y. lipolytica, eight alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes and one alcohol oxidase gene (FAO1) have been identified and respective deletion strains were tested for their ability to metabolize ethanol. As a result of this, we found that the availability of ADH1, ADH2 or ADH3 is required for ethanol utilization in Y. lipolytica. A strain with deletions in all three genes is lacking the ability to utilize ethanol as sole carbon source. Although Adh2p showed by far the highest enzyme activity in an in vitro assay, the availability of any of the three genes was sufficient to enable a decent growth. In addition to ADH1, ADH2 and ADH3, an acetyl-CoA synthetase encoding gene (ACS1) was found to be essential for ethanol utilization. As Y. lipolytica is a non-fermenting yeast, it is neither able to grow under anaerobic conditions nor to produce ethanol. To investigate whether Y. lipolytica may produce ethanol, the key genes of alcoholic fermentation in S. cerevisiae, ScADH1 and ScPDC1, were overexpressed in an ADH and an ACS1 deletion strain. However, instead of producing ethanol, the respective strains regained the ability to use ethanol as single carbon source and were still not able to grow under anaerobic conditions.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This is evident in overall body alterations such as average height and brain size. Although we can appreciate the uniqueness of our species in many aspects, molecular variations that drive such changes are far from being fully known and explained. Comparative genomics is able to determine variations in genomic sequence that may provide functional information to better understand species-specific adaptations. A large number of human-specific genomic variations have been reported but no currently available dataset comprises all of these, a problem which contributes to hinder progress in the field.\nHere we critically update high confidence human-specific genomic variants that mostly associate with protein-coding regions and find 856 related genes. Events that create such human-specificity are mainly gene duplications, the emergence of novel gene regions and sequence and structural alterations. Functional analysis of these human-specific genes identifies adaptations to brain, immune and metabolic systems to be highly involved. We further show that many of these genes may be functionally associated with neural activity and generating the expanded human cortex in dynamic spatial and temporal contexts.\nThis comprehensive study contributes to the current knowledge by considerably updating the number of human-specific genes following a critical bibliographic survey. Human-specific genes were functionally assessed for the first time to such extent, thus providing unique information. Our results are consistent with environmental changes, such as immune challenges and alterations in diet, as well as neural sophistication, as significant contributors to recent human evolution.\n","838":"\nThe characterization of cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation, through the comparison of the gene expression signature in respect to the native cancer cells, is particularly important for the identification of novel and more effective anticancer strategies. However, CSC have peculiar characteristics in terms of adhesion, growth, and metabolism that possibly implies a different modulation of the expression of the most commonly used housekeeping genes (HKG), like b-actin (ACTB). Although it is crucial to identify which are the most stable HKG genes to normalize the data derived from quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis to obtain robust and consistent results, an exhaustive validation of reference genes in CSC is still missing. Here, we isolated CSC spheres from different musculoskeletal sarcomas and carcinomas as a model to investigate on the stability of the mRNA expression of 15 commonly used HKG, in respect to the native cells. The selected genes were analysed for the variation coefficient and compared using the popular algorithms NormFinder and geNorm to evaluate stability ranking. As a result, we found that: 1) Tata Binding Protein (TBP), Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase\/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ), Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), and Hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) are the most stable HKG for the comparison between CSC and native cells; 2) at least four reference genes should be considered for robust results; 3) the use of ACTB should not be recommended, 4) specific HKG should be considered for studies that are focused only on a specific tumor type, like sarcoma or carcinoma. Our results should be taken in consideration for all the studies of gene expression analysis of CSC, and will substantially contribute for future investigations aimed to identify novel anticancer therapy based on CSC targeting. \n","839":"\nWe examined the function of the T-box transcription factor 1 (TBX1) in palatogenesis.\nTbx1-knockout mice were histologically examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Next, secondary palatal shelves dissected from wild type or Tbx1-knockout mice embryos at embryonic day 13.5 were investigated with microarray analysis, gene ontology analysis, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We performed gene profiling of developing palatal shelves from wild type and Tbx1-knockout embryos. We also analyzed the association of mouse genes linked to cleft palate with biological processes and compared the results with those of our ontology analysis of dysregulated genes in Tbx1-knockout palatal shelves.\nHistological analysis of Tbx1-knockout palate with complete cleft palate at postnatal day 1 showed aplasia of secondary palates associated with a small mandible and a small tongue compared to wild type littermates. Gene ontology analysis indicated that genes associated with development of the nervous system, muscle, and biomineral tissue were dysregulated in Tbx1-knockout palatal shelves. Furthermore, in Tbx1-knockout palatal shelves, genes associated with human cleft palate, specifically, myosin heavy chain 3 (Myh3) and nebulin (Neb), were downregulated and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor beta 3 subunit (Gabrb3) was upregulated.\nOur findings demonstrate that TBX1 maintains normal growth and development of palatal shelves, mediated through the regulation of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation, nervous system development, and biomineral tissue development. Multiple factors in Tbx1-knockout mice may lead to various subtypes of cleft palate.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is still a challenging task to extract biological knowledge from the GWAS data, due to such issues as missing heritability and weak interpretability. Indeed, the fact that the majority of discovered loci fall into noncoding regions without clear links to genes has been preventing the characterization of their functions and appealing for a sophisticated approach to bridge genetic and genomic studies. Towards this problem, network-based prioritization of candidate genes, which performs integrated analysis of gene networks with GWAS data, has emerged as a promising direction and attracted much attention. However, most existing methods overlook the sparse and noisy properties of gene networks and thus may lead to suboptimal performance. Motivated by this understanding, we proposed a novel method called REGENT for integrating multiple gene networks with GWAS data to prioritize candidate genes for complex diseases. We leveraged a technique called the network representation learning to embed a gene network into a compact and robust feature space, and then designed a hierarchical statistical model to integrate features of multiple gene networks with GWAS data for the effective inference of genes associated with a disease of interest. We applied our method to six complex diseases and demonstrated the superior performance of REGENT over existing approaches in recovering known disease-associated genes. We further conducted a pathway analysis and showed that the ability of REGENT to discover disease-associated pathways. We expect to see applications of our method to a broad spectrum of diseases for post-GWAS analysis.

Plant stem cells (SCs) play a key role in the regenerative capacity and lifelong activity of these plants. WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) genes are master regulators of plant SC pluripotency, but their functions in medicinal plants have not been previously reported. To investigate whether these genes define different SC niches in ginseng, we cloned and analysed five WOX genes in ginseng (PgWOXs) and found that they might regulate root reconstruction. Then, the whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization was used to characterize the 3D gene expression pattern of PgWOXs in ginseng seedlings and cultured adventitious roots. PgWOX4 was expressed in vascular cambium SCs; PgWOX5 and PgWOX11 were mainly expressed in the tips of seedling and adventitious roots, which are the energetic centre of the meristem; and PgWOX13a and PgWOX13b were detected in the parenchyma cells of the main root of seedlings and cultured adventitious roots, suggesting that they are important for maintaining the balance between SC differentiation and self-renewal in the phloem and xylem. This is the first report of SC regulation in medical herbs; we expect that P. ginseng can serve as a model herb for investigating the relationship between SCs and their herbal morphological features, which would be a new research direction to improve the yield and quality of the medicinal materials by regulating the herbal SCs.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Outside of the endocytic MHC pathway, GILT regulates the cellular redox state, inhibits T cell activation, neutralizes extracellular pathogens and is also a host factor of some bacterial pathogens. In this report, we isolated and characterized three divergent GILT-like genes, GILT1, GILT2 and GILT3, which share only 30.9-40.4% identities in a crustacean mud crab Scylla paramamosain. Whilst the crab GILT1 and GILT3 possess four and five exons, respectively, the GILT2 is intronless, suggesting that GILT2 may arise from a recent retroposition event. The invertebrate GILT-like genes have diverse gene organizations and may be evolved in a species\/lineage-specific manner as suggested by phylogenetic tree analysis. The amino acid sequences equivalent to human mature GILT are well conserved, including the GILT signature and nine of the ten cysteine residues that potentially form 5 disulfide bonds in human GILT, across the animal kingdom. However, most invertebrate GILT-like molecules lack the human-type N-terminal propeptide, as well as the human-type C-terminal with a conserved cysteine residue, suggesting differences in post translational processing and mode of action. All the three GILT-like genes are highly expressed in the hepatopancreas and up-regulated by pathogenic bacterial infection suggesting a role in immune defense against bacterial diseases. This study may provide the basis for further investigation of the expanding functions of GILT-like molecules in immunity and other physiological processes in mud crabs and other animals.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanism controlling this mutual exclusivity, associated with alterations in chromatin assembly, is not understood. Here, we determined how expression of the var gene family is regulated by two RecQ DNA helicase family members, PfRecQ1 and PfWRN, in P. falciparum Through genetic manipulation, we found that the complete var repertoire was silenced on PfRecQ1 knockout, whereas their expression did not show noticeable changes when PfWRN was knocked out. More important, mutually exclusive expression of var genes could be rescued by complementation of PfRecQ1. In addition, knocking out either of these two helicase genes changed the perinuclear cluster distribution of subtelomeres and subtelomeric var genes. Whereas deletion of PfRecQ1 increased the heterochromatin mark trimethylated (H3K9me3) at the transcription start site (TSS) of the var gene upsC1, that deletion had no effect on the global distribution of H3K9me3 over gene bodies, including those for the var genes. ChIP-seq assay showed that PfRecQ1 was enriched globally at the TSSs of all genes, whereas PfWRN-enriched regions occurred at the gene bodies of the var gene family, but not of other genes or at TSSs of all genes. On PfRecQ1 deletion, the upsC1 var gene moved from the active perinuclear transcription region to a silenced region of the upsC type. These findings imply that PfRecQ1, but not PfWRN, is essential for maintaining the clonal expression of var genes.\n","844":"\nThe aim of this study is to analyze gene expression data to identify key genes and pathways associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and to improve clinical treatment strategies. The gene expression data set was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and included 12 chemotherapy-resistant EOC samples and 16 chemotherapy-sensitive EOC samples. A differential analysis was performed to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A functional enrichment analysis was conducted for the DEGs using the database for annotation, visualization, and integration discovery. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed with information from the human protein reference database. Pathway-pathway interactions were determined with a test based on the hypergeometric distribution. A total of 1564 DEGs were identified in chemotherapy-sensitive EOC, including 654 upregulated genes and 910 downregulated genes. The top three upregulated genes were HIST1H3G, AKT3, and RTN3, while the top three downregulated genes were NBLA00301, TRIM62, and EPHA5. A Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that cell adhesion, biological adhesion, and intracellular signaling cascades were significantly enriched in the DEGs. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the calcium, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and B cell receptor signaling pathways were significantly over-represented in the DEGs. A PPI network containing 101 interactions was acquired. The top three hub genes were RAC1, CAV1, and BCL2. Five modules were identified from the PPI network. Taken together, these findings could advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic chemotherapy resistance in EOC. \n","845":"\nThe accumulating availability of next-generation sequencing data offers an opportunity to pinpoint driver genes that are causally implicated in oncogenesis through computational models. Despite previous efforts made regarding this challenging problem, there is still room for improvement in the driver gene identification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated approach called IntDriver for prioritizing driver genes. Based on a matrix factorization framework, IntDriver can effectively incorporate functional information from both the interaction network and Gene Ontology similarity, and detect driver genes mutated in different sets of patients at the same time. When evaluated through known benchmarking driver genes, the top ranked genes of our result show highly significant enrichment for the known genes. Meanwhile, IntDriver also detects some known driver genes that are not found by the other competing approaches. When measured by precision, recall and F1 score, the performances of our approach are comparable or increased in comparison to the competing approaches.\n","846":"\nEmbryo development represents a crucial developmental period in the life cycle of flowering plants. To gain insights into the genetic programs that control embryo development in Brassica rapa L., RNA sequencing technology was used to perform transcriptome profiling analysis of B. rapa developing embryos.

In total, 27,760, 28,871, 28,384, and 25,653 genes were identified from embryos at globular, heart, early cotyledon, and mature developmental stages, respectively, and analysis between stages revealed a subset of stage-specific genes. We next investigated 9,884 differentially expressed genes with more than fivefold changes in expression and false discovery rate \u2264 0.001 from three adjacent-stage comparisons; 1,514, 3,831, and 6,633 genes were detected between globular and heart stage embryo libraries, heart stage and early cotyledon stage, and early cotyledon and mature stage, respectively. Large numbers of genes related to cellular process, metabolism process, response to stimulus, and biological process were expressed during the early and middle stages of embryo development. Fatty acid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and photosynthesis-related genes were expressed predominantly in embryos at the middle stage. Genes for lipid metabolism and storage proteins were highly expressed in the middle and late stages of embryo development. We also identified 911 transcription factor genes that show differential expression across embryo developmental stages. These results increase our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events during embryo development in B. rapa and provide a foundation for future studies on other oilseed crops.\n","847":"\nAdzuki bean (Vigna angularis) is one of the most important legume crops in Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea due to its nutritious protein and starch contents. In spite of its economic importance, gene expression analysis system for gene function verification of adzuki bean is still absent.

A total of nine general housekeeping genes, including ACT, Fbox, ZMPP, GAPDH, EF, PP2A, UBC, UBN and PTB were evaluated for their expression stability by qRT-PCR in four adzuki bean cultivars, three different tissues, four abiotic stress and one biotic stress. The best group of candidates as reference genes were as follows: PTB and ACT for different cultivars; EF and UBN for different tissues; ACT and ZMPP for biotic stress and waterlogging stress; Fbox and UBC for salinity-alkalinity stress; Fbox and PTB for drought stress.

It also interacts with the well-known tumor suppressor protein p53 to trans-activate genes involved in cell cycle arrest. In this paper, we report an integrative analysis of genome-wide chromatin occupancy of BRD7 by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and digital gene expression (DGE) profiling by RNA-sequencing upon the overexpression of BRD7 in human cells. We localized 156 BRD7-binding peaks representing 184 genes by ChIP-sequencing, and most of these peaks were co-localized with histone modification sites. Four novel motifs were significantly represented in these BRD7-enriched regions. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that 22 of these BRD7 target genes were involved in a network regulating cell death and survival. DGE profiling identified 560 up-regulated genes and 1088 down-regulated genes regulated by BRD7. Using Gene Ontology and pathway analysis, we found significant enrichment of the cell cycle and apoptosis pathway genes. For the integrative analysis of the ChIP-seq and DEG data, we constructed a regulating network of BRD7 downstream genes, and this network suggests multiple feedback regulations of the pathways. Furthermore, we validated BIRC2, BIRC3, TXN2, and NOTCH1 genes as direct, functional BRD7 targets, which were involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis pathways. These results provide a genome-wide view of chromatin occupancy and the gene regulation network of the BRD7 signaling pathway. \n","849":"\nReverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a primary tool for measuring gene expression levels, and selection of appropriate reference genes is crucial for accurate and reproducible results of gene expression under various experimental conditions. However, no systematic evaluation of reference genes in pitaya (Hylocereus\u00a0undatus Britt.) has been performed. Here, we examined the expression of five candidate reference genes, namely elongation factor 1-alpha (HuEF1-\u03b1), 18S ribosomal RNA (Hu18S rRNA), ubiquitin (HuUBQ), actin (HuACT), and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (HuUQT), under different conditions in pitaya. The expression stabilities of these five genes were evaluated using two computation programs: geNorm and NormFinder. The results were further validated by normalizing the expression of the phosphoglycerate kinase (HuPGK) and ethylene-responsive transcription factor (HuERF) genes. Our results indicate that combined use of HuUBQ and HuUQT is the most stable reference under all of the experimental conditions examined. HuEF1-\u03b1, HuUBQ, and HuUQT are the top three most stable reference genes under salt stress, drought stress, and heat stress, and across different cultivars. HuEF1-\u03b1, HuACT, and HuUQT exhibited the most stable expression patterns across different tissues.

However, phenotypes associated with orthologous genes often turn out to be quite different between human and mouse. Herein, we devised a method to quantitatively compare phenotypes annotations associated with mouse models and human. Using semantic similarity comparisons, we identified orthologous genes with different phenotype annotations, of which the similarity score is on a par with that of random gene pairs. Analysis of sequence evolution and transcriptomic changes revealed that orthologous genes with phenotypic differences are correlated with changes in noncoding regulatory elements and tissue-specific expression profiles rather than changes in protein-coding sequences. To map accurate gene-phenotype relationships using model organisms, we propose that careful consideration of the evolutionary divergence of noncoding regulatory elements and transcriptomic profiles is essential.\n","851":"\nIn monocots, lignin content has a strong impact on the digestibility of the cell wall fraction. Engineering lignin biosynthesis requires a profound knowledge of the role of paralogues in the multigene families that constitute the monolignol biosynthesis pathway. We applied a bioinformatics approach for genome-wide identification of candidate genes in Lolium perenne that are likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of monolignols. More specifically, we performed functional subtyping of phylogenetic clades in four multigene families: 4CL, COMT, CAD and CCR. Essential residues were considered for functional clade delineation within these families. This classification was complemented with previously published experimental evidence on gene expression, gene function and enzymatic activity in closely related crops and model species. This allowed us to assign functions to novel identified L.\u00a0perenne genes, and to assess functional redundancy among paralogues. We found that two 4CL paralogues, two COMT paralogues, three CCR paralogues and one CAD gene are prime targets for genetic studies to engineer developmentally regulated lignin in this species. Based on the delineation of sequence conservation between paralogues and a first analysis of allelic diversity, we discuss possibilities to further study the roles of these paralogues in lignin biosynthesis, including expression analysis, reverse genetics and forward genetics, such as association mapping. We propose criteria to prioritise paralogues within multigene families and certain SNPs within these genes for developing genotyping assays or increasing power in association mapping studies. Although L.\u00a0perenne was the target of the analyses presented here, this functional subtyping of phylogenetic clades represents a valuable tool for studies investigating monolignol biosynthesis genes in other monocot species. \n\u00a9 2015 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.\n","852":"\nThe role of stress induced ethylene under low temperature stress has been controversial and hitherto remains unclear. In the present study, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD) gene, acdS expressing mutant strains were generated from ACCD negative psychrotolerant bacterial strains Flavobacterium sp. OR306 and Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis OS211, isolated from agricultural soil during late winter. After transformation with plasmid pRKACC which contained the acdS gene, both the strains were able to exhibit ACCD activity in vitro. The effect of this ACCD under chilling stress with regards to ethylene was studied in tomato plants inoculated with both acdS expressing and wild type bacteria. On exposing the plants to one week of chilling treatment at 12\/10 \u00b0C, it was found that stress ethylene, ACC accumulation and ACO activity which are markers of ethylene stress, were significantly reduced in plants inoculated with the acdS gene transformed mutants. In case of plants inoculated with strain OS211-acdS, ethylene emission, ACC accumulation and ACO activity was significantly reduced by 52%, 75.9% and 23.2% respectively compared to uninoculated control plants. Moreover, expression of cold induced LeCBF1 and LeCBF3 genes showed that these genes were significantly induced by the acdS transformed mutants in addition to reduced expression of ethylene-responsive transcription factor 13 (ETF-13) and ACO genes. Induced expression of LeCBF1 and LeCBF3 in plants inoculated with acdS expressing mutants compared to wild type strains show that physiologically evolved stress ethylene and its transcription factors play a role in regulation of cold induced genes as reported earlier in the literature.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the proper reference genes for RNA analysis in these two models have not yet been determined.\nIn this study, we evaluated the expression levels of six candidate housekeeping genes and selected the most suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR analyses of the cortices of MCAO mice and OGD\/R-injured N2a cells. Four software programs, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder, were used to validate the stabilities of the candidate reference genes. The results revealed that HPRT and 18S were the most stable reference genes in the cortices of MCAO mice and that \u03b2-actin and cyclophilin were the most stable reference genes in the OGD\/R-injured N2a cells; in contrast, GAPDH and Sdha were the least stable genes in the cortices of MCAO mice and the OGD\/R-injured N2a cells, respectively. Moreover, a combination of HPRT, 18S and cyclophilin was most suitable for normalization in analyses of the cortices of MCAO mice, and a combination of \u03b2-actin, cyclophilin, GAPDH, and 18S was most suitable for analyses of the OGD\/R-injured N2a cells.\nThis study provides appropriate reference genes for further RT-qPCR analyses of in vivo and in vitro ischemic stroke and demonstrates the necessity of validating reference genes for RNA analyses under variable conditions.\n","854":"\nTreatment of diseases with gene therapy is advancing rapidly. The use of gene therapy has expanded from the original concept of re-placing the mutated gene causing the disease to the use of genes to con-trol nonphysiological levels of expression or to modify pathways known to affect the disease. Genes offer numerous advantages over conventional drugs. They have longer duration of action and are more specific. Genes can be delivered to the target site by naked DNA, cells, nonviral, and viral vectors. The enormous progress of the past decade in molecular bi-ology and delivery systems has provided ways for targeting genes to the intended cell\/tissue and safe, long-term vectors. The eye is an ideal organ for gene therapy. It is easily accessible and it is an immune-privileged site. Currently, there are clinical trials for diseases affecting practically every tissue of the eye, including those to restore vision in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis. However, the number of eye trials compared with those for systemic diseases is quite low (1.8%). Nevertheless, judg-ing by the vast amount of ongoing preclinical studies, it is expected that such number will increase considerably in the near future. One area of great need for eye gene therapy is glaucoma, where a long-term gene drug would eliminate daily applications and compliance issues. Here, we review the current state of gene therapy for glaucoma and the possibilities for treating the trabecular meshwork to lower intraocular pressure and the retinal ganglion cells to protect them from neurodegeneration.\nCopyright\u00a9 2017 Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology.\n","855":"\nA discordant twin gestation, in which one fetus is significantly growth restricted, compared to the other normal twin, is a unique model that can be used to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which the intrauterine environment affects fetal growth. In many model systems, placental transcription factor genes regulate fetal growth. Transcription factors regulate growth through their activation or repression of downstream target genes that mediate important cell functions. The objective of this study was to determine the expression of the placental HLX homeobox gene transcription factor and its downstream target genes in dizygotic twins with growth discordance. In this cross-sectional study, HLX and its downstream target genes' retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) and cyclin kinase D (CDKN1C) expression levels were determined in placentae obtained from dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies (n = 23) where one of the twins was growth restricted. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) was defined as small for gestational age with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler indices when compared with the normal control co-twin. Homeobox gene HLX expression was significantly decreased at both the mRNA and protein levels in FGR twin placentae compared with the normal control co-twin placentae (p < .05). Downstream target genes CDKN1C and RB1 were also significantly decreased and increased, respectively, at both the mRNA and protein levels in FGR twin placentae compared with normal control co-twin placentae (p < .05). Together, these observations suggest an important association between HLX transcription factor expression and abnormal human placental development in discordant twin pregnancies.\n","856":"\nTherefore, the current study aimed to diagnose the genes associated in the pathogenesis of GBM. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were diagnosed using the limma software package. The ToppFun was used to perform pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, extracted modules, miRNA-target genes regulatory network and miRNA-target genes regulatory network were used to obtain insight into the actions of DEGs. Survival analysis for DEGs carried out. A total of 701 DEGs, including 413 upregulated and 288 downregulated genes, were diagnosed between U1118MG cell line (PK 11195 treated with 1\u2009h exposure) and U1118MG cell line (PK 11195 treated with 24\u2009h exposure). The up-regulated genes were enriched in superpathway of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis, cell cycle, cell cycle process and chromosome. The down-regulated genes were enriched in folate transformations I, biosynthesis of amino acids, cellular amino acid metabolic process and vacuolar membrane. The current study screened the genes in PPI network, extracted modules, miRNA-target genes regulatory network and miRNA-target genes regulatory network with higher degrees as hub genes, which included MYC, TERF2IP, CDK1, EEF1G, TXNIP, SLC1A5, RGS4 and IER5L Survival suggested that low expressed NR4A2, SLC7\u2009A5, CYR61 and ID1 in patients with GBM was linked with a positive prognosis for overall survival. In conclusion, the current study could improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms in the progression of GBM, and these crucial as well as new molecular markers might be used as therapeutic targets for GBM.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The ARK1 gene is one member of the ARBORKNOX family in all plants, which play an essential role in the process of plant growth and development, but the mechanism associated with its gene network regulation is poorly investigated. In order to generate over-expression transgenic hybrid poplar, the agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to obtain transgenic hybrid poplar '717' plants to provide insight into the function of the ARK1 gene in poplar. Moreover, the morphology of transgenic plants was observed, and transcriptome analysis was performed to explore the ARK1 gene function. The results showed that there were significant differences in pitch, stem diameter, petiole length, leaf width, leaf length and seedling height between ARK1 transgenic seedlings and non-transgenic seedlings. The transgenic seedlings usually had multiple branches and slender leaves, with some leaves not being fully developed. The results of transcriptome analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were involved in the growth of poplars, including proteins, transcription factors and protein kinases. Genes related to the positive regulation in plant hormone signal transduction pathways were up-regulated, and the genes related to lignin synthesis were down-regulated. The RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the expression levels of the genes involved in the plant hormone signal transduction pathways and phenylpropanoid pathway. In conclusion, the ARK1 gene had a positive regulatory effect on plant growth, and the gene's coding enzymes related to lignin synthesis were down-regulated.\n","858":"\nTranscriptome analysis aims at gaining insight into cellular processes through discovering gene expression patterns across various experimental conditions. Biclustering is a standard approach to discover genes subsets with similar expression across subgroups of samples to be identified. The result is a set of biclusters, each forming a specific submatrix of rows (e.g. genes) and columns (e.g. samples). Relevant biclusters can, however, be missed when, due to the presence of a few outliers, they lack the assumed homogeneity of expression values among a few gene\/sample combinations. The Max-Sum SubMatrix problem addresses this issue by looking at highly expressed subsets of genes and of samples, without enforcing such homogeneity.\nWe present here the K-CPGC algorithm to identify K relevant submatrices. Our main contribution is to show that this approach outperforms biclustering algorithms to identify several gene subsets representative of specific subgroups of samples. Experiments are conducted on 35 gene expression datasets from human tissues and yeast samples. We report comparative results with those obtained by several biclustering algorithms, including CCA, xMOTIFs, ISA, QUBIC, Plaid and Spectral. Gene enrichment analysis demonstrates the benefits of the proposed approach to identify more statistically significant gene subsets. The most significant Gene Ontology terms identified with K-CPGC are shown consistent with the controlled conditions of each dataset. This analysis supports the biological relevance of the identified gene subsets. An additional contribution is the statistical validation protocol proposed here to assess the relative performances of biclustering algorithms and of the proposed method. It relies on a Friedman test and the Hochberg's sequential procedure to report critical differences of ranks among all algorithms.\nWe propose here the K-CPGC method, a computationally efficient algorithm to identify K max-sum submatrices in a large gene expression matrix. Comparisons show that it identifies more significantly enriched subsets of genes and specific subgroups of samples which are easily interpretable by biologists. Experiments also show its ability to identify more reliable GO terms. These results illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of interpretability and of biological enrichment quality. Open implementation of this algorithm is available as an R package.\n","859":"\nThe neural crest is a transient population of cells that forms within the developing central nervous system and migrates away to generate a wide range of derivatives throughout the body during vertebrate embryogenesis. These cells are of evolutionary and clinical interest, constituting a key defining trait in the evolution of vertebrates and alterations in their development are implicated in a high proportion of birth defects and craniofacial abnormalities. In the hindbrain and the adjacent cranial neural crest cells (cNCCs), nested domains of Hox gene expression provide a combinatorial'Hox-code' for specifying regional properties in the developing head. Hox genes have been shown to play important roles at multiple stages in cNCC development, including specification, migration, and differentiation. However, relatively little is known about the underlying gene-regulatory mechanisms involved, both upstream and downstream of Hox genes. Furthermore, it is still an open question as to how the genes of the neural crest GRN are linked to Hox-dependent pathways. In this review, we describe Hox gene expression, function and regulation in cNCCs with a view to integrating these genes within the emerging gene regulatory network for cNCC development. We highlight early roles for Hox1 genes in cNCC specification, proposing that this may be achieved, in part, by regulation of the balance between pluripotency and differentiation in precursor cells within the neuro-epithelium. We then describe what is known about the regulation of Hox gene expression in cNCCs and discuss this from the perspective of early vertebrate evolution.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to construct gene co-expression networks to identify key modules and hub genes involved in the pathogenesis of OSCC.\nWe used dataset GSE30784 to construct co-expression networks by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Hub genes were screened and validated by other datasets.\nTurquoise and brown modules were found to be the most significantly related to tumorigenesis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the turquoise module was associated with cell-cell adhesion, extracellular matrix and collagen catabolic process. A total of 10 hub genes (MMP1, TNFRSF12A, PLAU, FSCN1, PDPN, KRT78, EVPL, GGT6, SMIM5 and CYSRT1) were identified and validated at transcriptional and translational levels. Their genetic alteration and survival analysis were also revealed.\nWe identified two modules and 10 hub genes, which were associated with the tumorigenesis of OSCC. The two modules provided references that will advance the understanding of mechanisms of tumorigenesis in OSCC. Moreover, the hub genes may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precise diagnosis and treatment of OSCC in the future.\n","861":"\nTriterpene saponins are main active constituents of Panax notoginseng. Metabolites profiling of 12 triterpene saponins was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in leaf, petiole, and root extracts of P.\u00a0notoginseng. Most of the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) type saponins, except ginsenoside Re, were mainly distributed in roots, while 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) type saponins were detected among various tissues. The total content of PPD-type saponins decreased in the order of leaf, petiole, and root. The expression patterns of four key genes (PnFPS, PnSQS, PnDS, and PnSE) in the triterpene saponin biosynthetic pathway were measured by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). All the four investigated genes showed high expression levels in leaf. A gene-to-metabolite network was constructed through canonical correlation analysis. The results indicated that the expression levels of PnFPS, PnSQS, PnDS, and PnSE had high correlation with PPD-type saponins ginsenoside Rb2 , Rb3 , and Rc, while PnSQS was also highly correlated with Rb1 . Combining metabolic profiling, RT-qPCR, and gene-to-metabolite network, we inferred that the leaf of P.\u00a0notoginseng was the main biosynthesis site of PPD-type saponins Rb2 , Rb3 , and Rc. The contribution to the biosynthesis of ginsenosides Rb2 , Rb3 , and Rc was in the order of PnSE > PnDS > PnSQS > PnFPS. PnSE and PnDS should be the preferred targets to regulate the production of PPD-type saponins Rb2 , Rb3 , and Rc in P.\u00a0notoginseng by plant metabolic engineering.\n\u00a9 2017 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.\n","862":"\nThe microtubule-associated protein tau undergoes aberrant modification resulting in insoluble brain deposits in various neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. Tau aggregates can form in different cell types of the central nervous system (CNS) but are most prevalent in neurons. We have previously recapitulated aspects of human FTD in mouse models by overexpressing mutant human tau in CNS neurons, including a P301S tau variant in TAU58\/2 mice, characterized by early-onset and progressive behavioral deficits and FTD-like neuropathology. The molecular mechanisms underlying the functional deficits of TAU58\/2 mice remain mostly elusive. Here, we employed functional genomics (i.e. RNAseq) to determine differentially expressed genes in young and aged TAU58\/2 mice to identify alterations in cellular processes that may contribute to neuropathy. We identified genes in cortical brain samples differentially regulated between young and old TAU58\/2 mice relative to nontransgenic littermates and by comparative analysis with a dataset of CNS cell type-specific genes expressed in nontransgenic mice. Most differentially-regulated genes had known or putative roles in neurons and included presynaptic and excitatory genes. Specifically, we observed changes in presynaptic factors, glutamatergic signaling, and protein scaffolding. Moreover, in the aged mice, expression levels of several genes whose expression was annotated to occur in other brain cell types were altered. Immunoblotting and immunostaining of brain samples from the TAU58\/2 mice confirmed altered expression and localization of identified and network-linked proteins. Our results have revealed genes dysregulated by progressive tau accumulation in an FTD mouse model.\n\u00a9 2019 Ke et al.\n","863":"\nPancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most common causes of cancer mortality worldwide. As the genetic mechanism of this complex disease is not uncovered clearly, identification of related genes of PC is of great significance that could provide new insights into gene function as well as potential therapy targets. In this study, we performed an integrated network method to discover PC candidate genes based on known PC related genes. Utilizing the subnetwork extraction algorithm with gene co-expression profiles and protein-protein interaction data, we obtained the integrated network comprising of the known PC related genes (denoted as seed genes) and the putative genes (denoted as linker genes). We then prioritized the linker genes based on their network information and inferred six key genes (KRT19, BARD1, MST1R, S100A14, LGALS1 and RNF168) as candidate genes of PC. Further analysis indicated that all of these genes have been reported as pancreatic cancer associated genes. Finally, we developed an expression signature using these six key genes which significantly stratified PC patients according to overall survival (Logrank p = 0.003) and was validated on an independent clinical cohort (Logrank p = 0.03). Overall, the identified six genes might offer helpful prognostic stratification information and be suitable to transfer to clinical use in PC patients.\n","864":"\nDrug combinations that include a psychostimulant such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor such as fluoxetine are indicated in several medical conditions. Co-exposure to these drugs also occurs with \"cognitive enhancer\" use by individuals treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Methylphenidate, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, by itself produces some addiction-related gene regulation in the striatum. We have demonstrated that co-administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors potentiates these methylphenidate-induced molecular effects, thus producing a more \"cocaine-like\" profile. There is evidence that the 5-HT1B serotonin receptor subtype mediates some of the cocaine-induced gene regulation. We thus investigated whether the 5-HT1B receptor also modifies methylphenidate-induced gene regulation, by assessing effects of a selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist (CP94253) on immediate-early gene markers ( Zif268, c- Fos, Homer1a) in adolescent male rats. Gene expression was measured by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Our results show that CP94253 (3, 10 mg\/kg) produced a dose-dependent potentiation of methylphenidate (5 mg\/kg)-induced expression of Zif268 and c- Fos. This potentiation was widespread in the striatum and was maximal in lateral (sensorimotor) sectors, thus mimicking the effects seen after cocaine alone, or co-administration of fluoxetine. However, in contrast to fluoxetine, this 5-HT1B agonist did not influence methylphenidate-induced expression of Homer1a. CP94253 also potentiated methylphenidate-induced locomotor activity. These findings indicate that stimulation of the 5-HT1B receptor can enhance methylphenidate (dopamine)-induced gene regulation. This receptor may thus participate in the potentiation induced by fluoxetine (serotonin) and may serve as a pharmacological target to attenuate methylphenidate + selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced \"cocaine-like\" effects.\n","865":"\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (>200 nt) are expressed at levels lower than those of the protein-coding mRNAs, and in all eukaryotic model species where they have been characterized, they are transcribed from thousands of different genomic loci. In humans, some four dozen lncRNAs have been studied in detail, and they have been shown to play important roles in transcriptional regulation, acting in conjunction with transcription factors and epigenetic marks to modulate the tissue-type specific programs of transcriptional gene activation and repression. In Schistosoma mansoni, around 10,000 lncRNAs have been identified in previous works. However, the limited number of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries that had been previously assessed, together with the use of old and incomplete versions of the S. mansoni genome and protein-coding transcriptome annotations, have hampered the identification of all lncRNAs expressed in the parasite. Here we have used 633 publicly available S. mansoni RNA-seq libraries from whole worms at different stages (n = 121), from isolated tissues (n = 24), from cell-populations (n = 81), and from single-cells (n = 407). We have assembled a set of 16,583 lncRNA transcripts originated from 10,024 genes, of which 11,022 are novel S. mansoni lncRNA transcripts, whereas the remaining 5,561 transcripts comprise 120 lncRNAs that are identical to and 5,441 lncRNAs that have gene overlap with S. mansoni lncRNAs already reported in previous works. Most importantly, our more stringent assembly and filtering pipeline has identified and removed a set of 4,293 lncRNA transcripts from previous publications that were in fact derived from partially processed mRNAs with intron retention. We have used weighted gene co-expression network analyses and identified 15 different gene co-expression modules. Each parasite life-cycle stage has at least one highly correlated gene co-expression module, and each module is comprised of hundreds to thousands lncRNAs and mRNAs having correlated co-expression patterns at different stages. Inspection of the top most highly connected genes within the modules' networks has shown that different lncRNAs are hub genes at different life-cycle stages, being among the most promising candidate lncRNAs to be further explored for functional characterization.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Maciel, Morales-Vicente, Silveira, Ribeiro, Olberg, Pires, Amaral and Verjovski-Almeida.\n","866":"\nGene and genome duplication play important roles in the evolution of gene function. Compared to individual duplicated genes, gene clusters attract particular attention considering their frequent associations with innovation and adaptation. Here, we report for the first time the expansion of the apolipoprotein D (ApoD) ligand-transporter genes in a cluster manner specific to teleost fishes.\nBased on comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses, protein 3D structure comparison, positive selection detection and breakpoints detection, the single ApoD gene in the ancestor expanded into two clusters following a dynamic evolutionary pattern in teleost fishes. Orthologous genes show conserved expression patterns, whereas lineage-specific duplicated genes show tissue-specific expression patterns and even evolve new gene expression profiles. Positive selection occurred in branches before and after gene duplication, especially for lineage-specific duplicated genes. Cluster analyses based on protein 3D structure comparisons, especially comparisons of the four loops at the opening side, show gene duplication-segregating patterns. Duplicated ApoD genes are predicted to be associated with forkhead transcription factors and MAPK genes. ApoD clusters are located next to the breakpoints of genome rearrangements.\nHere, we report the expansion of ApoD genes specific to teleost fishes in a cluster manner for the first time. Neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization were observed at both the protein and expression levels after duplication. Evidence from different aspects-i.e., abnormal expression-induced disease in humans, fish-specific expansion, predicted associations with forkhead transcription factors and MAPK genes, specific expression patterns in tissues related to sexual selection and adaptation, duplicated genes under positive selection and their location next to the breakpoints of genome rearrangements-suggests the potentially advantageous roles of ApoD genes in teleost fishes. The cluster expansion of ApoD genes specific to teleost fishes provides thus an ideal evo-devo model for studying gene duplication, cluster maintenance and new gene function emergence.\n","867":"\nMethylation of promoter CpG islands may suppress the function of miRNAs by inhibiting their expression. Our work analyzes the role of promoter methylation in altering the expression of 12 miRNAs associated with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC): miR-124-3p, -125b-5p, -127-5p, -129-5p, -132-3p, -137, -148a-3p, -191-5p, -193a-5p, -203a, -339-3p, and -375. The role of methylation in the deregulation of these miRNAs has not been previously assessed in a representative set of EOC samples. Using 76 paired (tumor\/matched normal) ovarian samples and methylation-specific PCR, we demonstrated significant aberrations in the methylation patterns of 11 miRNA genes and identified 8 novel hypermethylated miRNA genes (MIR-124-1, -124-2, -124-3, -127, -132, -137, -193A, and -339) as well as one hypomethylated miRNA gene (MIR-191). Quantitative PCR on a subset of 29 paired EOC samples allowed us to establish a strong correlation between methylation status and alterations in expression levels for all 12 miRNAs studied. These findings demonstrate the functional role of aberrant methylation of examined miRNA genes in EOC. Moreover, we showed a significant association of hypermethylation of 10 miRNA genes (MIR-124-2, -124-3, -125B-1, -127, -129-2, -137, -193A, -203A, -339, -375) with EOC metastasis to lymph nodes, peritoneum, and distant organs. Interestingly, MIR-203A and MIR-375 were hypermethylated only in disseminated ovarian tumors, implying that non-suppressor miR-203a and miR-375 have anti-metastatic properties. Hypermethylation of 10 miRNA genes in EOC metastases was validated using an additional sample set of 13 primary tumors and matched peritoneal metastases. Together, these results show the impact of aberrant methylation on deregulation of 12 miRNAs in EOC, the involvement of 10 hypermethylated miRNA genes in metastasis (including peritoneal macro-metastases), and suggest novel potential biomarkers.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of 37 strains within the genus Acidithiobacillus to answer the untouched questions as to the mechanisms and the evolutionary history of metal resistance genes in Acidithiobacillus spp. The results showed that the evolutionary history of metal resistance genes in Acidithiobacillus spp. involved a combination of gene gains and losses, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and gene duplication. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that metal resistance genes in Acidithiobacillus spp. were acquired by early HGT events from species that shared habitats with Acidithiobacillus spp., such as Acidihalobacter, Thiobacillus, Acidiferrobacter, and Thiomonas species. Multicopper oxidase genes involved in copper detoxification were lost in iron-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus ferridurans, Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and were replaced by rusticyanin genes during evolution. In addition, widespread purifying selection and the predicted high expression levels emphasized the indispensable roles of metal resistance genes in the ability of Acidithiobacillus spp. to adapt to harsh environments. Altogether, the results suggested that Acidithiobacillus spp. recruited and consolidated additional novel functionalities during the adaption to challenging environments via HGT, gene duplication, and purifying selection. This study sheds light on the distribution, organization, functionality, and complex evolutionary history of metal resistance genes in Acidithiobacillus spp.IMPORTANCE Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), natural selection, and gene duplication are three main engines that drive the adaptive evolution of microbial genomes. Previous studies indicated that HGT was a main adaptive mechanism in acidophiles to cope with heavy-metal-rich environments. However, evidences of HGT in Acidithiobacillus species in response to challenging metal-rich environments and the mechanisms addressing how metal resistance genes originated and evolved in Acidithiobacillus are still lacking. The findings of this study revealed a fascinating phenomenon of putative cross-phylum HGT, suggesting that Acidithiobacillus spp. recruited and consolidated additional novel functionalities during the adaption to challenging environments via HGT, gene duplication, and purifying selection. Altogether, the insights gained in this study have improved our understanding of the metal resistance strategies of Acidithiobacillus spp.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 American Society for Microbiology.\n","870":"\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) have been utilized for classification and prediction task with remarkable accuracy.

Cells taken from bovine myometrium on days 1-5, 6-10, 11-16 and 17-20 of the oestrous cycle and in weeks 3-5, 6-8 and 9-12 of pregnancy were used. Reverse transcribed RNA was amplified in real-time PCR using designed primers. Reaction efficiency was determined with the Linreg programme. The geNorm and NormFinder programmes were used to select the best housekeeping genes. They calculate the expression stability factor for each used housekeeping gene with the smallest value for most stably expressed genes. According to geNorm, the most stable housekeeping genes in the myometrium were C2orf29, TPB and TUBB2B, while the least stably expressed genes were 18S RNA, HPRT1 and GAPDH. NormFinder identified the best genes in the myometrium as C2orf29, MRPL12 and TBP, while the worst genes were 18S RNA, B2M and SF3A1. Differences in stability factors between the two programmes may also indicate that the physiological status of the female, e.g. pregnancy, affects the stability of expression of housekeeping genes. The different expression stability of housekeeping genes did not affect progesterone receptor expression but it could be important if small differences in gene expression were measured between studies. \n","872":"\nQuantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is a high-throughput method to analyze the transcriptional expression of genes.

These results will improve the understanding of the biology of the false spider mites and their role as virus vectors.\n","873":"\nLarge collections of paraffin-embedded tissue represent a rich resource to test hypotheses based on gene expression patterns; however, measurement of genome-wide expression is cost-prohibitive on a large scale. Using the known expression correlation structure within a given disease type (in this case, high grade serous ovarian cancer; HGSC), we sought to identify reduced sets of directly measured (DM) genes which could accurately predict the expression of a maximized number of unmeasured genes.\nWe developed a greedy gene set selection (GGS) algorithm which returns a DM set of user specified size based on a specific correlation threshold (|rP|) and minimum number of DM genes that must be correlated to an unmeasured gene in order to infer the value of the unmeasured gene (redundancy). We evaluated GGS in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HGSC data across 144 combinations of DM size, redundancy (1-3), and |rP| (0.60, 0.65, 0.70). Across the parameter sweep, GGS allows on average 9 times more gene expression information to be captured compared to the DM set alone. GGS successfully augments prognostic HGSC gene sets; the addition of 20 GGS selected genes more than doubles the number of genes whose expression is predictable. Moreover, the expression prediction is highly accurate. After training regression models for the predictable gene set using 2\/3 of the TCGA data, the average accuracy (ranked correlation of true and predicted values) in the 1\/3 testing partition and four independent populations is above 0.65 and approaches 0.8 for conservative parameter sets. We observe similar accuracies in the TCGA HGSC RNA-sequencing data. Specifically, the prediction accuracy increases with increasing redundancy and increasing |rP|.\nGGS-selected genes, which maximize expression information about unmeasured genes, can be combined with candidate gene sets as a cost effective way to increase the amount of gene expression information obtained in large studies. This method can be applied to any organism, model system, disease, or tissue type for which whole genome gene expression data exists.\n","874":"\nMaize (Zea mays) displays an exceptional level of structural genomic diversity, which is likely unique among higher eukaryotes. In this study, we surveyed how the genetic divergence of two maize inbred lines affects the transcriptomic landscape in four different primary root tissues of their F1-hybrid progeny. An extreme instance of complementation was frequently observed: genes that were expressed in only one parent but in both reciprocal hybrids. This single-parent expression (SPE) pattern was detected for 2341 genes with up to 1287 SPE patterns per tissue. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded that of their parents in each tissue by >400. SPE patterns are highly dynamic, as illustrated by their excessive degree of tissue specificity (80%). The biological significance of this type of complementation is underpinned by the observation that a disproportionally high number of SPE genes (75 to 82%) is nonsyntenic, as opposed to all expressed genes (36%). These genes likely evolved after the last whole-genome duplication and are therefore younger than the syntenic genes. In summary, SPE genes shape the remarkable gene expression plasticity between root tissues and complementation in maize hybrids, resulting in a tissue-specific increase of active genes in F1-hybrids compared with their inbred parents. \n\u00a9 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

This study reveals biomarkers related to HGSOC incidence and progression using the bioinformatics method. MATERIAL AND METHODS Five gene expression profiles were downloaded from GEO. Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in HGSOC and normal ovarian tissue samples were screened using limma and the function of DEGs was annotated by KEGG and GO analysis using clusterProfiler. A co-expression network utilizing the WGCNA package was established to define several hub genes from the key module. Furthermore, survival analysis was performed, followed by expression validation with datasets from TCGA and GTEx. Finally, we used single-gene GSEA to detect the function of prognostic hub genes. RESULTS Out of the 1874 DEGs detected from 114 HGSOC versus 49 normal tissue samples, 956 were upregulated and 919 were downregulated. The functional annotation indicated that upregulated DEGs were mostly enriched in cell cycle, whereas the downregulated DEGs were enriched in the MAPK or Ras signaling pathway. Two modules significantly associated with HGSOC were excavated through WGCNA. After survival analysis and expression validation of hub genes, we found that 2 upregulated genes (MAD2L1 and PKD2) and 3 downregulated genes (DOCK5, FANCD2 and TBRG1) were positively correlated with HGSOC prognosis. GSEA for single-hub genes revealed that MAD2L1 and PKD2 were associated with proliferation, while DOCK5, FANCD2, and TBRG1 were associated with immune response. CONCLUSIONS We found that FANCD2, PKD2, TBRG1, and DOCK5 had prognostic value and could be used as potential biomarkers for HGSOC treatment.\n","876":"\nWatermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is one of the major cucurbit crop that cultivated all over the world. Adaptability and flowering time are important agronomic characteristics that influence the quality and yield of watermelon, however, the molecular basis underlying these traits were still unclear. In this study, we identified 166, 182, 178, and 279 flowering genes in watermelon, melon, cucumber and pumpkin, respectively, and found that a lot of genes in the photoperiodic, autonomous, and vernalization pathways were absence in the four cucurbits. A higher ratio of flowering time genes was identified in the hormone pathway in cucurbits than in Arabidopsis, and a higher average ka\/ks value of hormone pathway genes than the photoperiodic and vernalization pathway genes was identified in watermelon. Moreover, a gene ClGA2\/KS (Cla005482) were found to associated with ecotype differentiation, flowering time, and whole growth period in watermelon. This study added knowledge to the molecular basis of flowering time regulation in cucurbits, and the molecule marker of ClGA2\/KS gene may facilitate the breeding progress for selecting watermelon varieties with superior adaption and flowering time.\n","877":"\nInsects undergo metamorphosis, involving an abrupt change in body structure through cell growth and differentiation. Rice stem stripped borer (SSB), Chilo suppressalis, is one of the most destructive rice pests. However, little is known about the regulation mechanism of metamorphosis development in this notorious insect pest. Here, we studied the expression of 22,197 SSB genes at seven time points during pupa development with a customized microarray, identifying 622 differentially expressed genes (DEG) during pupa development. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these DEGs indicated that the genes related to substance metabolism were highly expressed in the early pupa, which participate in the physiological processes of larval tissue disintegration at these stages. In comparison, highly expressed genes in the late pupal stages were mainly associated with substance biosynthesis, consistent with adult organ formation at these stages. There were 27 solute carrier (SLC) genes that were highly expressed during pupa development. We knocked down SLC22A3 at the prepupal stage, demonstrating that silencing SLC22A3 induced a deficiency in pupa stiffness and pigmentation. The RNAi-treated individuals had white and soft pupa, suggesting that this gene has an essential role in pupal development.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

While gene size has been shown to be important for the expression timing of specific genes during early development, whether it plays a role in the timing of other global gene expression programs has not been extensively explored. Here, we investigate the role of gene length during the early transcriptional response of human fibroblasts to serum stimulation. Using the nascent sequencing techniques Bru-seq and BruUV-seq, we identified immediate genome-wide transcriptional changes following serum stimulation that were linked to rapid activation of enhancer elements. We identified 873 significantly induced and 209 significantly repressed genes. Variations in gene size allowed for a large group of genes to be simultaneously activated but produce full-length RNAs at different times. The median length of the group of serum-induced genes was significantly larger than the median length of all expressed genes, housekeeping genes, and serum-repressed genes. These gene length relationships were also observed in corresponding mouse orthologs, suggesting that relative gene size is evolutionarily conserved. The sizes of transcription factor and microRNA genes immediately induced after serum stimulation varied dramatically, setting up a cascade mechanism for temporal expression arising from a single activation event. The retention and expansion of large intronic sequences during evolution have likely played important roles in fine-tuning the temporal expression of target genes in various cellular response programs.\n","879":"\nApomixis is a naturally occurring asexual mode of seed reproduction resulting in offspring genetically identical to the maternal plant. Identifying differential gene expression patterns between apomictic and sexual plants is valuable to help deconstruct the trait. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is a popular method for analyzing gene expression. Normalizing gene expression data using proper reference genes which show stable expression under investigated conditions is critical in qRT-PCR analysis. We used qRT-PCR to validate expression and stability of six potential reference genes (EF1alpha, EIF4A, UBCE, GAPDH, ACT2 and TUBA) in vegetative and reproductive tissues of B-2S and B-12-9 accessions of C. ciliaris.\nAmong tissue types evaluated, EF1alpha showed the highest level of expression while TUBA showed the lowest. When all tissue types were evaluated and compared between genotypes, EIF4A was the most stable reference gene. Gene expression stability for specific ovary stages of B-2S and B-12-9 was also determined. Except for TUBA, all other tested reference genes could be used for any stage-specific ovary tissue normalization, irrespective of the mode of reproduction.\nOur gene expression stability assay using six reference genes, in sexual and apomictic accessions of C. ciliaris, suggests that EIF4A is the most stable gene across all tissue types analyzed. All other tested reference genes, with the exception of TUBA, could be used for gene expression comparison studies between sexual and apomictic ovaries over multiple developmental stages. This reference gene validation data in C. ciliaris will serve as an important base for future apomixis-related transcriptome data validation.\n","880":"\nKentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) belong to Gramineae and is widely used in lawns, golf courses, landscapes, and sport fields as a prominent cool-season grass. Gene expression patterns during different stages of plant development can provide clues toward the understanding of its biological functions. The selection and validation of reference genes are the first steps in any real-time quantitative PCR gene expression study. Therefore, suitable reference genes are necessary for obtaining reliable results in real-time quantitative PCR analyses of Kentucky bluegrass. In the present study, 9 candidate reference genes were chosen, and their expression stability in the leaves and roots of Kentucky bluegrass under different stresses (drought, salt, heat, and cold) were evaluated using the GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder programs. The results showed that the expression stability of the candidate reference genes was dependent on the experimental conditions. The combination of SAM with GAPDH was the most stable in leaves under salt stress and cold stress, while TUB combined with ACT or GAPDH was stable in roots under salt or cold stress, respectively. ACT and SAM maintained stable expression in drought-treated leaves, and GAPDH combined with ACT was stable in drought-treated roots. SAM and TUB exhibited stable expression in heat-treated leaves. ACT and RPL were stable in heat-treated roots. In addition, the expression patterns of PpFEH in response to drought and cold stress were used to confirm the reliability of the selected reference genes, indicating that the use of an inappropriate reference gene as the internal control will cause erroneous results. This work is the first study on the expression stability of reference genes in Kentucky bluegrass and will be particularly useful in the selection of stress-tolerance genes and the identification of the molecular mechanisms conferring stress tolerance in this species.\n","881":"\nAccumulating evidence has revealed that the mammalian heart possesses a measurable capacity for renewal. Neonatal mice retain a regenerative capacity over a short time-frame (\u22646 days), but this capacity is lost by 7 days of age. In the present study, differential gene expression profiling of mouse cardiac tissue was performed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this process. The global gene expression patterns of the neonatal C57BL\/6J mouse heart were examined at three key time-points (1, 6 and 7 days old) using digital gene expression analysis. In the distribution of total clean tags, high-expression tags (>100 copies) were found to be predominant, whereas low expression tags (<5 copies) occupied the majority of distinct tag distributions. In total, 306 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in cardiac tissue, with the expression levels of 115 genes upregulated and those of 191 genes downregulated in 7-day-old mice compared with expression levels in 1- and 6-day-old mice, respectively. The expression levels of five DEGs were confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gene ontology analysis revealed a large proportion of DEGs distributed throughout the cell, and these DEGs were associated with binding as well as catalytic, hydrolase, transferase and molecular transducer activities. Furthermore, these genes were involved in cellular, metabolic and developmental processes, as well as biological regulation and signaling pathways. Pathway analysis identified the oxidative phosphorylation pathway to be the process most significantly putatively affected by the differential expression of these genes. These data provide the basis for future analysis of the gene expression patterns that regulate the molecular mechanism of cardiac regeneration.\n","882":"\nIn this study, antibiotic resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) antibiotics in total microbial community in surface water in a coastal urban city was measured using a modified fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. This FISH technique quantified the rate of antibiotic resistance to MLSB antibiotics through targeting methylation site of A2058 of 23S rRNAs resulting from expressed erythromycin ribosome methylation (erm) genes. Correlations between the rates of MLSB resistance measured by FISH and macrolide concentrations was stronger than that between the relative abundance of erm genes and macrolide concentrations, especially in residential areas where the main detected antibiotics were macrolides. These results suggest that trace levels of antibiotics in environmental waters, which was as low as 40\u202fng\u202fL-1, may still play important roles in the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. Additionally, methylation as a result of erm gene expression, instead of erm gene abundance, was a better indicator of selective pressure of trace level macrolides. The rates of MLSB resistance varied significantly among land use types, suggesting that anthropogenic activities are important factors to select for erm gene expression in the environment. Microbial community analysis of representative surface water samples showed that relatively high rates of MLSB resistance were observed in Alphaproteobacteria (42%), Acidobacteria (36%), Bacteroidaceae (32%), Chloroflexi (27%), and Betaproteobacteria (20.2%).\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A random insertion transposon library of 240,000 mutants in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was used to monitor effects of individual bacterial gene disruptions on bacteriophage P22 lytic infection. These experiments revealed candidate host genes that alter the timing of phage P22 propagation. Using a False Discovery Rate of <\u00a00.1, mutations in 235 host genes either blocked or delayed progression of P22 lytic infection, including many genes for which this role was previously unknown. Mutations in 77 genes reduced the survival time of host DNA after infection, including mutations in genes for enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) synthesis and osmoregulated periplasmic glucan (OPG). We also screened over 2000 Salmonella single gene deletion mutants to identify genes that impacted either plaque formation or culture growth rates. The gene encoding the periplasmic membrane protein YajC was newly found to be essential for P22 infection. Targeted mutagenesis of yajC shows that an essentially full-length protein is required for function, and potassium efflux measurements demonstrated that YajC is critical for phage DNA ejection across the cytoplasmic membrane.\n\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n","884":"\nCorynebacterium glutamicum is widely used for amino acid production. In the present study, 543 genes showed a significant change in their mRNA expression levels in L-lysine-producing C. glutamicum ATCC21300 than that in the wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC13032. Among these 543 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 28 genes were up- or downregulated. In addition, 454 DEGs were functionally enriched and categorized based on BLAST sequence homologies and gene ontology (GO) annotations using the Blast2GO software. Interestingly, NCgl0071 (bioB, encoding biotin synthase) was expressed at levels ~20-fold higher in the L-lysine-producing ATCC21300 strain than that in the wild-type ATCC13032 strain. Five other genes involved in biotin metabolism or transport--NCgl2515 (bioA, encoding adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate aminotransferase), NCgl2516 (bioD, encoding dithiobiotin synthetase), NCgl1883, NCgl1884, and NCgl1885--were also expressed at significantly higher levels in the L-lysine-producing ATCC21300 strain than that in the wild-type ATCC13032 strain, which we determined using both next-generation RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. When we disrupted the bioB gene in C. glutamicum ATCC21300, L-lysine production decreased by approximately 76%, and the three genes involved in biotin transport (NCgl1883, NCgl1884, and NCgl1885) were significantly downregulated. These results will be helpful to improve our understanding of C. glutamicum for industrial amino acid production.\n","885":"\nWilms tumor (WT) is the most common type of renal malignancy in children. Survival rates are low and high\u2011risk WT generally still carries a poor prognosis. To better elucidate the pathogenesis and tumorigenic pathways of high\u2011risk WT, the present study presents an integrated analysis of RNA expression profiles of high\u2011risk WT to identify predictive molecular biomarkers, for the improvement of therapeutic decision\u2011making. mRNA sequence data from high\u2011risk WT and adjacent normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using R software. From 132\u00a0Wilms tumor samples and six normal samples, 2,089\u00a0downregulated and 941\u00a0upregulated DEGs were identified. In order to identify hub DEGs that regulate target genes, weighted gene co\u2011expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify 11 free\u2011scale gene co\u2011expressed clusters. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were annotated using KEGG Orthology Based Annotation System annotation of different module genes. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes was used to construct a protein\u2011protein interaction network for the identified DEGs, and the hub genes of WGCNA modules were identified using the Cytohubb plugin with Cytoscape software. Survival analysis was subsequently performed to highlight hub genes with a clinical signature. The present results suggest that epidermal growth factor, cyclin dependent kinase 1, endothelin receptor type A, nerve growth factor receptor, opa\u2011interacting protein 5, NDC80 kinetochore complex component and cell division cycle associated 8 are essential to high\u2011risk WT pathogenesis, and they are closely associated with clinical prognosis.\n","886":"\nDown-regulation of stemness genes expression is important in differentiation therapy against cancer stem cells (CSCs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the Oct4 , Sox2, Nanog, and C-myc expression in rat breast cancer stem cells (LA7) which treated with human ovarian follicular fluid (FF), replicative senescent fibroblast culture supernatant (P14), and 16\u00a0h serum starved fibroblast supernatant (16\u00a0h-SFS). The cells were exposed to these biological fluids for 24\u00a0h, 72\u00a0h, and 7\u00a0days. Stem-loop RT-qPCR assay was used to quantify the expression of above mentioned genes. Results showed that FF had the least cytotoxic effect on the LA7 cells. Except for Nanog gene, exposure of LA7 cell line to 16\u00a0h-SFS and P14 decreased significantly expression of the three other genes after 24\u00a0h (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Nanog and Sox2 genes expression was also decreased in LA7 cells which have been already treated with FF for 24\u00a0h. Moreover, compared to the control solution, the expression of Oct4 increased significantly after 7\u00a0days exposure to FF (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Annexin V-PE \/7-AAD-, acridine orange\/ethidium bromide staining and doubling time assays revealed apoptosis and necrosis induction by these biological fluids in LA7 cells. Moreover, in an in vitro model of metastasis assay, i.e., scratch test, these fluids exhibited anti-LA7 migration activity which culminated in 16\u00a0h-SFS treated cells. Generally, this study showed that FF, 16\u00a0h-SFS, and P14 have positive effects on down-regulation of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and C-myc expression, and consequently can increase the differentiation of breast cancer stem cells. For the first time, this study provided some evidence indicating that some biological fluids have potential to differentiate the CSCs, show anti- survival, growth-, and cell migration activity.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020.

Because of the intrinsic difficulties in genome manipulation in this fungus, most studies have been focused on gene expression analysis using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR is a powerful technique but its reliability resides in the correct selection of a set of reference genes used in the data normalization. In this study, we determined the expression stability of 11 selected reference genes in H. annosum. Almost nothing has so far been published about validation of a set of reference genes to be used in gene expression experiments in this fungus. Eleven reference genes were validated in H. annosum which was grown on three different substrates: pine bark, pine heartwood, and pine sapwood. Bestkeeper and NormFinder Excel-based software were used to evaluate the reference gene transcripts' stability. The results from these two programs indicated that three reference genes namely Tryp metab, RNA Pol3 TF, and Actin were stable in H. annosum in the conditions studied. Interestingly, the GAPDH transcript which has been extensively used in qPCR data normalization is not the best choice when a wide reference gene selection is available. This work represents the first extensive validation of reference genes in H. annosum providing support for gene expression studies and benefits for the wider forest pathology community.\n","888":"\nThe use of reference genes is the most common method of controlling the variation in mRNA expression during quantitative polymerase chain reaction, although the use of traditional reference genes, such as \u03b2\u2011actin, glyceraldehyde\u20113\u2011phosphate dehydrogenase or 18S ribosomal RNA, without validation occasionally leads to unreliable results. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate a set of five commonly used reference genes to determine the most suitable for gene expression studies in normal ovarian tissues, borderline ovarian and ovarian cancer tissues. The expression stabilities of these genes were ranked using two gene stability algorithms, geNorm and NormFinder. Using geNorm, the two best reference genes in ovarian cancer were \u03b2\u2011glucuronidase and \u03b2\u2011actin. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase\u20111 and \u03b2\u2011glucuronidase were the most stable in ovarian borderline tumours, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase\u20111 and glyceraldehyde\u20113\u2011phosphate dehydrogenase were the most stable in normal ovarian tissues. NormFinder ranked \u03b2\u2011actin the most stable in ovarian cancer, and the best combination of two genes was \u03b2\u2011glucuronidase and \u03b2\u2011actin. In borderline tumours, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase\u20111 was identified as the most stable, and the best combination was hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase\u20111 and \u03b2\u2011glucuronidase. In normal ovarian tissues, \u03b2\u2011glucuronidase was recommended as the optimum reference gene, and the most optimum pair of reference genes was hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase\u20111 and \u03b2\u2011actin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the selection of a set of reference genes for normalisation in quantitative polymerase chain reactions in different ovarian tissues, and therefore it is recommended that \u03b2\u2011glucuronidase, \u03b2\u2011actin and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase\u20111 are the most suitable reference genes for such analyses.\n","889":"\nAlpha tubulin is a fundamental component of the cytoskeleton which is responsible for cell shape and is involved in cell division, ciliary and flagellar motility and intracellular transport. Alpha tubulin gene expression varies according to the morphological changes suffered by Leishmania in its life cycle. However, the objective of studying the mechanisms responsible for the differential expression has resulted to be a difficult task due to the complex genome organization of tubulin genes and to the non-conventional mechanisms of gene regulation operating in Leishmania.\nWe started this work by analyzing the genomic organization of \u03b1-tubulin genes in the Leishmania braziliensis genome database. The genomic organization of L. braziliensis \u03b1-tubulin genes differs from that existing in the L. major and L. infantum genomes. Two loci containing \u03b1-tubulin genes were found in the chromosomes 13 and 29, even though the existence of sequence gaps does not allow knowing the exact number of genes at each locus. Southern blot assays showed that \u03b1-tubulin locus at chromosome 13 contains at least 8 gene copies, which are tandemly organized with a 2.08-kb repetition unit; the locus at chromosome 29 seems to contain a sole \u03b1-tubulin gene. In addition, it was found that L. braziliensis \u03b1-tubulin locus at chromosome 13 contains two types of \u03b1-tubulin genes differing in their 3' UTR, each one presumably containing different regulatory motifs. It was also determined that the mRNA expression levels of these genes are controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms tightly linked to the growth temperature. Moreover, the decrease in the \u03b1-tubulin mRNA abundance observed when promastigotes were cultured at 35\u00b0C was accompanied by parasite morphology alterations, similar to that occurring during the promastigote to amastigote differentiation.\nInformation found in the genome databases indicates that \u03b1-tubulin genes have been reorganized in a drastic manner along Leishmania speciation. In the L. braziliensis genome database, two loci containing \u03b1-tubulin sequences were found, but only the locus at chromosome 13 contains the prototypic \u03b1-tubulin genes, which are repeated in a head-to-tail manner. Also, we determined that the levels of \u03b1-tubulin mRNAs are down-regulated drastically in response to heat shock by a post-transcriptional mechanism which is dependent upon active protein synthesis.\n","890":"\nThe chlorate-respiring bacterium Ideonella dechloratans is a facultative anaerobe that can use both oxygen and chlorate as terminal electron acceptors. The genes for the enzymes chlorate reductase (clrABDC) and chlorite dismutase, necessary for chlorate metabolism and probably acquired by lateral gene transfer, are located in a gene cluster that also includes other genes potentially important for chlorate metabolism. Among those are a gene for cytochrome c (cyc) whose gene product may serve as an electron carrier during chlorate reduction, a cofactor biosynthesis gene (mobB) and a predicted transcriptional regulator (arsR). Only chlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase have been shown to be expressed in vivo. Here, we report the in vivo production of a single polycistronic transcript covering eight open reading frames including clrABDC, cyc, mobB and arsR. Transcription levels of the cyc and clrA genes were compared to each other by the use of qRT-PCR in RNA preparations from cells grown under aerobic or chlorate reducing anaerobic conditions. The two genes showed the same mRNA levels under both growth regimes, indicating that no transcription termination occurs between them. Higher transcription levels were observed at growth without external oxygen supply. Implications for electron pathway integration following lateral gene transfer are discussed. \n\u00a9 FEMS 2015.

Annotation of functional variants to the genes, including cis or trans and understanding their biological pathway\/gene network enrichments, is expected to give rich dividends by elucidating the mechanisms underlying prostate cancer. To this aim, we compiled and analysed currently available post-GWAS data that is validated through further studies in prostate cancer, to investigate molecular biological pathways enriched for assigned functional genes. In total, about 100 canonical pathways were significantly, at false discovery rate (FDR)< 0.05), enriched in assigned genes using different algorithms. The results have highlighted some well-known cancer signalling pathways, antigen presentation processes and enrichment in cell growth and development gene networks, suggesting risk loci may exert their functional effect on prostate cancer by acting through multiple gene sets and pathways. Additional upstream analysis of the involved genes identified critical transcription factors such as HDAC1 and STAT5A. We also investigated the common genes between post-GWAS and three well-annotated gene expression datasets to endeavour to uncover the main genes involved in prostate cancer development\/progression. Post-GWAS generated knowledge of gene networks and pathways, although continuously evolving, if analysed further and targeted appropriately, will have an important impact on clinical management of the disease.\n","892":"\nThe present study performed an integral analysis of the gene expression and DNA methylation profile of pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was also performed to examine and identify the genes correlated to PAs, to identify candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of PAs. The DNA methylation profile and gene expression profile were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Following screening of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs), respectively, integrated analysis of the DEGs and DMRs was performed to detect their correlation. Subsequently, the WGCNA algorithm was applied to identify the significant modules and construct the co\u2011expression network associated with PAs. Furthermore, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the associated genes was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. A total number of 2,259 DEGs and 235 DMRs were screened out. Integrated analysis revealed that 30 DEGs were DMRs with prominent negative correlation (cor=\u20110.82; P=0.02). Based on the DEGs, the gene co\u2011expression network was constructed, and nine network modules associated with PAs were identified. The functional analysis results showed that genes relevant to PAs were closely associated with cell differentiation modulation. The screened PA-associated genes were significantly different at the expression and methylation levels. These genes may be used as reliable candidate target genes for the treatment of PAs.\n","893":"\nWe aimed to identify crucial genes relevant to the development of consecutive trauma-induced sepsis.A microarray dataset was used to identify genes differentially expressed between peripheral blood samples from consecutive traumatized patients complicated with sepsis and not complicated with sepsis. The dataset GSE12624 was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus, containing 34 peripheral blood samples from consecutive traumatized patients complicated by sepsis and 36 consecutive traumatized controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using Linear Models for Microarray Data package. Then, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for DEGs was performed by Onto-Express. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and pathway enrichment analysis was performed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). Furthermore, protein complexes in the PPI network were predicted by ClusterONE and validated through GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses, and protein domain analysis.Totally, 446 upregulated and 447 downregulated DEGs were identified. Some DEGs were related to acyl-CoA binding (eg, ACBD6), chromosome, and centromeric region (eg, CENPN). In the PPI network, some DEGs were enriched in renin-angiotensin system (RAS, eg, AGTR1 and AGTR2). Three predicted protein complexes were validated in the PPI network. Some genes composing protein complex A were associated with cell proliferation (eg, CDC20, CCNB1, MCM4, RPA2, and PRIM2), and several genes composing protein complex F were implicated in regulation of actin cytoskeleton (eg, PFN2, ARPC2, and WASL).The results suggest that those DEGs may be crucial in the etiology of consecutive trauma-induced sepsis, and they are expected to be therapeutic targets.\n","894":"\nGene expression studies which utilize lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages to model immune signaling are widely used for elucidating the mechanisms of inflammation-related disease. When expression levels of target genes are quantified using Real-Time quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), they are analyzed in comparison to reference genes, which should have stable expression. Judicious selection of reference genes is, therefore, critical to interpretation of qRT-PCR results. Ideal reference genes must be identified for each experimental system and demonstrated to remain constant under the experimental conditions. In this study, we evaluated the stability of eight common reference genes: Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), Cyclophilin A\/Peptidylprolyl isomerase A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH), Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase 1, Large Ribosomal Protein P0, TATA box binding protein, Ubiquitin C (UBC), and Ribosomal protein L13A. Expression stability of each gene was tested under different conditions of LPS stimulation and compared to untreated controls. Reference gene stabilities were analyzed using Ct value comparison, NormFinder, and geNorm. We found that UBC, closely followed by B2M, is the most stable gene, while the commonly used reference gene GAPDH is the least stable. Thus, for improved accuracy in evaluating gene expression levels, we propose the use of UBC to normalize PCR data from LPS-stimulated macrophages.\n\u00a9 The Author 2016.

In the present study, expression analysis of six different constitutively expressed genes viz. 18S ribosomal RNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), beta actin (\u03b2actin), ribosomal binding protein L13, tubulin and TATA-box-binding protein (tbp) were carried out to test their efficacy as reference genes in three different tissues, namely liver, gill and muscle of murrel Channa striatus exposed to high temperature for variable time periods. The stability and suitability of the genes were determined by using bioinformatic tools: GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. Based on the results, tub\/\u03b2actin could be used as the reference genes for liver and gill tissues and \u03b2actin\/gapdh could be the reference genes for muscle tissues in Channa striatus under both short- and long-term thermal stress. \n","896":"\nAtherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process characterized by the accumulation and formation of lipid-rich plaques within the layers of the arterial wall. Although numerous studies have reported the underlying pathogenesis, no data-based studies have been conducted to analyze the potential genes and immune cells infiltration in the different stages of atherosclerosis via bioinformatics analysis.\nIn this study, we downloaded GSE100927 and GSE28829 from NCBI-GEO database. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment were performed via the DAVID database. The protein interaction network was constructed via STRING. Enriched hub genes were analyzed by the Cytoscape software. The evaluation of the infiltrating immune cells in the dataset samples was performed by the CIBERSORT algorithm.\nWe identified 114 common upregulated differentially expressed genes and 22 common downregulated differentially expressed genes. (adjust p value\u2009<\u20090.01 and log FC \u2265 1). A cluster of 10 genes including CYBA, SLC11A1, FCER1G, ITGAM, ITGB2, CD53, ITGAX, VAMP8, CLEC5A, and CD300A were found to be significant. Through the deconvolution algorithm CIBERSORT, we analyzed the significant alteration of immune cells infiltration in the progression of atherosclerosis with the threshold of the Wilcoxon test at p value <0.05.\nThese results may reveal the underlying correlations between genes and immune cells in atherosclerosis, which enable us to investigate the novel insights for the development of treatments and drugs.\n","897":"\nData normalization is a key step in gene expression analysis by qPCR. Endogenous control genes are used to estimate variations and experimental errors occurring during sample preparation and expression measurements. However, the transcription level of the most commonly used reference genes can vary considerably in samples obtained from different individuals, tissues, developmental stages and under variable physiological conditions, resulting in a misinterpretation of the performance of the target gene(s). This issue has been scarcely approached in woody species such as grapevine.\nA statistical criterion was applied to select a sub-set of 19 candidate reference genes from a total of 242 non-differentially expressed (NDE) genes derived from a RNA-Seq experiment comprising ca. 500 million reads obtained from 14 table-grape genotypes sampled at four phenological stages. From the 19 candidate reference genes, VvAIG1 (AvrRpt2-induced gene) and VvTCPB (T-complex 1 beta-like protein) were found to be the most stable ones after comparing the complete set of genotypes and phenological stages studied. This result was further validated by qPCR and geNorm analyses.\nBased on the evidence presented in this work, we propose to use the grapevine genes VvAIG1 or VvTCPB or both as a reference tool to normalize RNA expression in qPCR assays or other quantitative method intended to measure gene expression in berries and other tissues of this fruit crop, sampled at different developmental stages and physiological conditions.\n","898":"\nEcdysteroids play an essential role in controlling insect development and reproduction. Their pathway is regulated by a group of enzymes called Halloween gene proteins. The relationship between the Halloween genes and ecdysteroid synthesis has yet to be clearly understood in diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a worldwide Lepidoptera pest attacking cruciferous crops and wild plants. In this study, complete sequences for six Halloween genes, neverland (nvd), shroud (sro), spook (spo), phantom (phm), disembodied (dib), shadow (sad), and shade (shd), were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a strong conservation in insects, including Halloween genes of P. xylostella that was clustered with all other Lepidoptera species. Three Halloween genes, dib, sad, and shd were highly expressed in the adult stage, while nvd and spo were highly expressed in the egg and pupal stages, respectively. Five Halloween genes were highly expressed specifically in the prothorax, which is the major site of ecdysone production. However, shd was expressed predominantly in the fat body to convert ecdysone into 20-hydroxyecdysone. RNAi-based knockdown of sad, which is involved in the last step of ecdysone biosynthesis, significantly reduced the 20E titer and resulted in a longer developmental duration and lower pupation of fourth-instar larvae, as well as caused shorter ovarioles and fewer fully developed eggs of P. xylostella. Furthermore, after the knockdown of sad, the expression levels of Vg and VgR genes were significantly decreased by 77.1 and 53.0%. Meanwhile, the number of eggs laid after 3 days was significantly reduced in sad knockdown females. These results suggest that Halloween genes may play a critical role in the biosynthesis of ecdysteroids and be involved in the development and reproduction of P. xylostella. Our work provides a solid basis for understanding the functional importance of these genes, which will help to screening potential genes for pest management of P. xylostella.\n","899":"\nThe present study aimed to examine 10 housekeeping genes (HKGs), including 18s ribosomal RNA (18S), glyceraldehyde\u20113\u2011phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein large P0 (RPLP0), \u03b2\u2011actin (ACTB), peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), phosphoglycerate kinase\u20111 (PGK1), \u03b2\u20112\u2011microglobulin (B2M), ribosomal protein LI3a (RPL13A), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase\u20111 (HPRT1) and TATA box binding protein (TBP) in order to identify the most stable and suitable reference genes for use in expression studies in non\u2011small cell lung cancer. The mRNA expression encoding the panel of the 10 HKGs was determined using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR (RT\u2011qPCR) in human lung cancer cell lines. Three software programs, BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm, were used to ascertain the most suitable reference genes to normalize the RNA input. The present study examined three lung cancer cell lines (A549, NCI\u2011H446 and NCI\u2011H460). The analysis of the experimental data using BestKeeper software revealed that all 10 HKGs were stable, with GADPH, followed by 18S being the most stable genes and PPIA and HPRT1 being the least stable genes. The NormFinder software results demonstrated that PPIA followed by ACTB were the most stable and B2M and RPLP0 were the least stable. The geNorm software results revealed that ACTB and PGK1, followed by PPIA were the most stable genes and B2M and RPLP0 were identified as the least stable genes. Due to discrepancies in the ranking orders of the reference genes obtained by different analyzing software programs, it was not possible to determine a single universal reference gene. The suitability of selected reference genes requires unconditional validation prior to each study. Based on the three analyzing programs, ACTB, PPIA and PGK1 were the most stable reference genes in lung cancer cell lines.\n","900":"\nEnterovirus G (EV-G) belongs to the family of Picornaviridae. Two types of recombinant porcine EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C\/3A genes, while PLPC gene replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3\u202fkb-long upstream flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the downstream ~0.9\u202fkb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G. The amount of type 1 and type 2 recombinant EV-G genomes was almost same in the pig feces. Although the phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two recombinant EV-Gs have independently evolved, type 1 recombinant EV-G might have served as a helper virus by providing viral structural proteins for dissemination of the type 2 recombinant EV-G.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019.

Compared with tissue regeneration, and somatic embryogenesis, de novo shoot regeneration denotes a shoot regeneration process directly from detatched or injured tissues of plant. Studies on plant shoot regeneration had identified key genes mediating shoot regeneration. However, knowledge was derived from Arabidopsis; the regeneration capacity is hugely distinct among species. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the shoot regeneration mechanism from tree species, we select four genetic lines of Populus euphratica from a natural population to be sequenced at transcriptome level. On the basis of the large difference of differentiation capacity, between the highly differentiated (HD) and low differentiated (LD) groups, the analysis of differential expression identified 4920 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were revealed in five groups of expression patterns by clustering analysis. Enrichment showed crucial pathways involved in regulation of regeneration difference, including \"plant hormone signal transduction\", \"cell differentiation\", \"cellular response to auxin stimulus\", and \"auxin-activated signaling pathway\". The expression of nine genes reported to be associated with shoot regeneration was validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). For the specificity of regeneration mechanism with P. euphratica, large amount of DEGs involved in \"plant-pathogen interaction\", ubiquitin-26S proteosome mediated proteolysis pathway, stress-responsive DEGs, and senescence-associated DEGs were summarized to possibly account for the differentiation difference with distinct genotypes of P. euphratica. The result in this study helps screening of key regulators in mediating the shoot differentiation. The transcriptomic characteristic in P. euphratica further enhances our understanding of key processes affecting the regeneration capacity of de novo shoots among distinct species.\n","902":"\nNeural stem cells (NSCs) have unique biological characteristics such as continuous proliferation and multipotential differentiation, providing a possible method for restoration of central nervous system (CNS) function after injury or disease. NSCs and astrocytes share many similar biological properties including cell morphology and molecular expression and can trans-differentiate into each other under certain conditions. However, characteristic genes specifically expressed by NSCs have not been well described.\nTo provide insights into the characteristic expression of NSCs, bioinformatics analysis of two microarrays of mouse NSCs and astrocytes was performed. Compared to astrocytes, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NSCs were identified and annotated by GO, KEGG and GSEA analysis, respectively. Then key genes were screened by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and modules analysis, and were verified using multiple high-throughput sequencing resources. Finally, the expression difference between the two cell types was confirmed by Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR), western blotting and immunochemical analysis.\nIn the present study, 282 and 250 NSC-enriched genes from two microarrays were identified and annotated respectively, and the 77 overlapping DEGs were then selected. From the PPI network 24 key genes in three modules were screened out. Importantly, sequencing data of tissues showed that these 24 key genes tended to be highly expressed in NSCs compared with astrocytes. Furthermore, qPCR and western blot analysis of cultured NSCs and astrocytes showed two genes (KIF2C and TOP2A) were not only differentially expressed in RNA level but also at the protein level. Importantly, the NSC-specific genes KIF2C and TOP2A were validated by immunohistochemistry in vivo.\nIn present study, we identified 2 hub genes (KIF2C and TOP2A) that might serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing NSCs from astrocytes, contributing to our comprehensive understanding of the biological properties and functions of NSCs.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018.

Using a gene-based association research strategy, the present study aims to detect unknown susceptibility to RA and to address the ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility to RA between European and Asian populations.\nGene-based association analyses were performed with KGG 2.5 by using publicly available large RA datasets (14,361 RA cases and 43,923 controls of European subjects, 4,873 RA cases and 17,642 controls of Asian Subjects). For the newly identified RA-associated genes, gene set enrichment analyses and protein-protein interactions analyses were carried out with DAVID and STRING version 10.0, respectively. Differential expression verification was conducted using 4 GEO datasets. The expression levels of three selected 'highly verified' genes were measured by ELISA among our in-house RA cases and controls.\nA total of 221 RA-associated genes were newly identified by gene-based association study, including 71'overlapped', 76 'European-specific' and 74 'Asian-specific' genes. Among them, 105 genes had significant differential expressions between RA patients and health controls at least in one dataset, especially for 20 genes including 11 'overlapped' (ABCF1, FLOT1, HLA-F, IER3, TUBB, ZKSCAN4, BTN3A3, HSP90AB1, CUTA, BRD2, HLA-DMA), 5 'European-specific' (PHTF1, RPS18, BAK1, TNFRSF14, SUOX) and 4 'Asian-specific' (RNASET2, HFE, BTN2A2, MAPK13) genes whose differential expressions were significant at least in three datasets. The protein expressions of two selected genes FLOT1 (P value = 1.70E-02) and HLA-DMA (P value = 4.70E-02) in plasma were significantly different in our in-house samples.\nOur study identified 221 novel RA-associated genes and especially highlighted the importance of 20 candidate genes on RA. The results addressed ethnic genetic background differences for RA susceptibility between European and Asian populations and detected a long list of overlapped or ethnic specific RA genes. The study not only greatly increases our understanding of genetic susceptibility to RA, but also provides important insights into the ethno-genetic homogeneity and heterogeneity of RA in both ethnicities.\n","904":"\nA wide variety of Salmonella enterica serovars cause intestinal and systemic infections to humans and animals. Salmonella Patogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1) is a chromosomal region containing 39 genes that have crucial virulence roles. The AraC-like transcriptional regulator HilD, encoded in SPI-1, positively controls the expression of the SPI-1 genes, as well as of several other virulence genes located outside SPI-1. In this study, we applied a clustering method to the global gene expression data of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium from the COLOMBOS database; thus genes that show an expression pattern similar to that of SPI-1 genes were selected. This analysis revealed nine novel genes that are co-expressed with SPI-1, which are located in different chromosomal regions. Expression analyses and protein-DNA interaction assays showed regulation by HilD for six of these genes: gtgE, phoH, sinR, SL1263 (lpxR) and SL4247 were regulated directly, whereas SL1896 was regulated indirectly. Interestingly, phoH is an ancestral gene conserved in most of bacteria, whereas the other genes show characteristics of genes acquired by Salmonella. A role in virulence has been previously demonstrated for gtgE, lpxR and sinR. Our results further expand the regulon of HilD and thus identify novel possible Salmonella virulence genes.\n","905":"\nGene and genome duplication fosters genetic novelty, but redundant gene copies would undergo mutational decay unless preserved via selective or neutral forces. Molecular mechanisms mediating duplicate preservation remain incompletely understood. Several recent studies showed an association between DNA methylation and expression divergence of duplicated genes and suggested a role of epigenetic mechanism in duplicate retention. Here, we compare genome-wide gene-body CG methylation (BCGM) and duplicate gene expression between a rice mutant null for OsMet1-2(a major CG methytransferase in rice) and its isogenic wild-type. We demonstrate a causal link between BCGM divergence and expression difference of duplicate copies. Interestingly, the higher- and lower-expressing copies of duplicates as separate groups show broadly different responses with respect to direction of expression alteration upon loss of BCGM. A role for BCGM in conditioning expression divergence between copies of duplicates generally holds for duplicates generated by whole genome duplication (WGD) or by small-scale duplication processes. However, differences are evident among these categories, including a higher proportion of WGD duplicates manifesting expression alteration, and differential propensities to lose BCGM by the higher- and lower-expression copies in the mutant. Together, our results support the notion that differential epigenetic marking may facilitate long-term retention of duplicate genes.\n","906":"\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to identify more genes associated with MS.\nBased on the publicly available data of the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes, we conducted a powerful gene-based GWAS in an initial sample with 931 family trios, and a replication study sample with 978 cases and 883 controls. For interesting genes, gene expression in MS-related cells between MS cases and controls was examined by using publicly available datasets.\nA total of 58 genes was identified, including 20 \"novel\" genes significantly associated with MS (p<1.40\u00d710\u207b\u2074). In the replication study, 44 of the 58 identified genes had been genotyped and 35 replicated the association. In the gene-expression study, 21 of the 58 identified genes exhibited differential expressions in MS-related cells. Thus, 15 novel genes were supported by replicated association and\/or differential expression. In particular, four of the novel genes, those encoding myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), coiled-coil alpha-helical rod protein 1 (CCHCR1), human leukocyte antigen complex group 22 (HCG22), and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DM alpha (HLA-DMA), were supported by the evidence of both.\nThe results of this study emphasize the high power of gene-based GWAS in detecting the susceptibility genes of MS. The novel genes identified herein may provide new insights into the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying MS.\n","907":"\nGlioma is a highly invasive, rapidly spreading form of brain cancer, while its etiology is largely unknown. A few recently reported studies have been developed using gene expression microarrays of glioma to identify differentially expressed genes from several to hundreds. This study was designed to analyze vast amounts of glioma-related microarray data and screen the key genes and pathways related to the development and progression of glioma. We used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and meta-analysis of seven included studies after standardized microarray preprocessing, which increased concordance between these gene datasets. After GSEA, there were 14 mixing pathways including 13 up- and 1 down-regulated pathways. Based on the meta-analysis, 268 significant genes were screened out (P\u2009<\u20090.05); there were 249 genes identified by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and 27 KEGG pathways closely related to the set of the imported genes were identified. At last, six consistent pathways and key genes in these pathways related to glioma were obtained with combined GSEA and meta-analysis. The gene pathways that we identified could provide insight concerning the development of glioma. Further studies are needed to determine the biological function for the positive genes.\n","908":"\nIdentification of cancer prognostic genes is important in that it can lead to accurate outcome prediction and better therapeutic trials for cancer patients. Many computational approaches have been proposed to achieve this goal; however, there is room for improvement. Recent developments in deep learning techniques can aid in the identification of better prognostic genes and more accurate outcome prediction, but one of the main problems in the adoption of deep learning for this purpose is that data from cancer patients have too many dimensions, while the number of samples is relatively small. In this study, we propose a novel network-based deep learning method to identify prognostic gene signatures via distributed gene representations generated by G2Vec, which is a modified Word2Vec model originally used for natural language processing. We applied the proposed method to five cancer types including liver cancer and showed that G2Vec outperformed extant feature selection methods, especially for small number of samples. Moreover, biomarkers identified by G2Vec was useful to find significant prognostic gene modules associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.\n","909":"\nThe selection of suitable reference genes is crucial to accurately evaluate and normalize the relative expression level of target genes for gene function analysis. However, commonly used reference genes have variable expression levels in developing skeletal muscle. There are few reports that systematically evaluate the expression stability of reference genes across prenatal and postnatal developing skeletal muscle in mammals. Here, we used quantitative PCR to examine the expression levels of 15 candidate reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, RNF7, RHOA, RPS18, RPL32, PPIA, H3F3, API5, B2M, AP1S1, DRAP1, TBP, WSB, and VAPB) in porcine skeletal muscle at 26 different developmental stages (15 prenatal and 11 postnatal periods). We evaluated gene expression stability using the computer algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. Our results indicated that GAPDH and ACTB had the greatest variability among the candidate genes across prenatal and postnatal stages of skeletal muscle development. RPS18, API5, and VAPB had stable expression levels in prenatal stages, whereas API5, RPS18, RPL32, and H3F3 had stable expression levels in postnatal stages. API5 and H3F3 expression levels had the greatest stability in all tested prenatal and postnatal stages, and were the most appropriate reference genes for gene expression normalization in developing skeletal muscle. Our data provide valuable information for gene expression analysis during different stages of skeletal muscle development in mammals. This information can provide a valuable guide for the analysis of human diseases.\n","910":"\nIntracranial aneurysms (IAs) are characterized by localized dilation or ballooning of a cerebral artery. When IAs rupture, blood leaks into the space around the brain to create a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The latter is associated with a higher risk of disability and mortality. The aims of this study were to gain greater insight into the pathogenesis of ruptured IAs, and to clarify whether identified hub genes represent potential biological markers for assessing the likelihood of IA progression and rupture. Briefly, the GSE36791 and GSE73378 datasets from the National Center of Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database were reanalyzed and subjected to a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to test the association between gene sets and clinical features. The clinical significance of these genes as potential biomarkers was also examined, with their expression validated by quantitative real-time PCR. A total of 14 co-expression modules and 238 hub genes were identified. In particular, three modules (labeled turquoise, blue, and brown) were found to highly correlate with IA rupture events. Additionally, six potential biomarkers were identified (BASP1, CEBPB, ECHDC2, GZMK, KLHL3, and SLC2A3), which are strongly associated with the progression and rupture of IAs. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into potential molecular mechanisms responsible for IAs and they highlight the potential for these particular genes to serve as biomarkers for monitoring IA rupture.\n","911":"\nAlthough rye is one of the most cold-tolerant species among temperate cereals, its huge and complex genome has prevented us from identifying agronomically useful genes. However, advances in high-throughput sequencing technology are making it increasingly possible to investigate its genome. The C-repeat binding factor (CBF) gene family controls cold tolerance in plants and its members are well conserved among eudicots and monocots, among which there are diverse homologs. Despite its large genome, only a small number of CBF genes have been identified in rye. In this study, we explored high-throughput sequencing data of the rye genome and identified 12 novel CBF genes. Sequence analyses revealed that these genes contain signature sequences of the CBF family. Chromosomal localization of the genes by PCR using wheat-rye addition lines showed that most of these are located on the long arm of chromosome 5, but also on the long arm of chromosomes 2 and 6. On the basis of comparative analyses of CBF family members in the Triticeae, CBF proteins were divided into several groups according to phylogenetic relationship and conserved motifs. Light is essential to fully induce CBF gene expression and there is specificity in the response to different types of abiotic stresses in ScCBF genes. The results of our study will assist investigations of CBF genes in the Triticeae and the mechanism of cold tolerance through the CBF-dependent pathway in plants.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Cytoscape, String tools and DAVID tools were used to investigate the biological pathways encoded by the genes identified as being either upregulated or downregulated in CRC, to determine protein\u2011protein interactions and to identify potential hub genes associated with CRC. As a result, a total of 3,264\u00a0genes were identified as being differentially expressed in CRC and adjacent tissues, including 1,594\u00a0downregulated and 1,670 upregulated genes. Furthermore, 306\u00a0genes were revealed to be clustered in a complex interaction network, and the top 20\u00a0hub genes in this network were determined by application of the Matthews Correlation Coefficient algorithm. In addition, the patterns of the expression levels of the 20\u00a0hub genes were investigated using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that four of the 20\u00a0hub genes encoded small subunit processome components (UTP3 small subunit processome component; UTP14 small subunit processome component; UTP\u00a018 small subunit processome component; and UTP20 small subunit processome component) and a further four encoded WD repeat domains (WD repeat\u2011containing protein\u00a03, WD repeat domain 12, WD repeat\u2011containing protein 43 and WD repeat\u2011containing protein 75). In conclusion, the present DNA microarray study identified genes involved in the pathogenesis of CRC. Furthermore, it was revealed that hub genes identified from among the total identified upregulated and downregulated genes in CRC encoding subunit processome components and WD repeat domains may represent novel target molecules for future treatments of CRC.\n","913":"\nLilium is an important commercial market flower bulb. qRT-PCR is an extremely important technique to track gene expression levels. The requirement of suitable reference genes for normalization has become increasingly significant and exigent. The expression of internal control genes in living organisms varies considerably under different experimental conditions. For economically important Lilium, only a limited number of reference genes applied in qRT-PCR have been reported to date. In this study, the expression stability of 12 candidate genes including \u03b1-TUB, \u03b2-TUB, ACT, eIF, GAPDH, UBQ, UBC, 18S, 60S, AP4, FP, and RH2, in a diverse set of 29 samples representing different developmental processes, three stress treatments (cold, heat, and salt) and different organs, has been evaluated. For different organs, the combination of ACT, GAPDH, and UBQ is appropriate whereas ACT together with AP4, or ACT along with GAPDH is suitable for normalization of leaves and scales at different developmental stages, respectively. In leaves, scales and roots under stress treatments, FP, ACT and AP4, respectively showed the most stable expression. This study provides a guide for the selection of a reference gene under different experimental conditions, and will benefit future research on more accurate gene expression studies in a wide variety of Lilium genotypes. \n","914":"\nGene silencing by RNA interference is a particularly important tool in the study of gene function in polyploid cereal species for which the collections of natural or induced mutants are very limited. Previously we have been testing small interfering RNA-based approach of gene silencing in wheat and triticale. In this research, artificial microRNAs (amiRs) were studied in the same species and the same target genes to compare effectiveness of both gene silencing pathways. amiR cassettes were designed to silence Puroindoline a (Pina) and Puroindoline b (Pinb) hardness genes in wheat and their orthologues Secaloindoline a (Sina) and Secaloindoline b (Sinb) genes in triticale. Each of the two cassettes contained 21 nt microRNA (miR) precursor derived from conserved regions of Pina\/Sina or Pinb\/Sinb genes, respectively. Transgenic plants were obtained with high efficiency in two cultivars of wheat and one cultivar of triticale after using the Pinb-derived amiR vector for silencing of Pinb or Sinb, respectively. Lack of transgenic plants in wheat or very low transformation efficiency in triticale was observed using the Pina-derived amiR cassette, despite large numbers of embryos attempted. Silencing of Pinb in wheat and Sinb in triticale was highly efficient in the T1 generation. The transcript level of Pinb in wheat was reduced up to 92% and Sinb in triticale was reduced up to 98%. Moreover, intended silencing of Pinb\/Sinb with Pinb-derived amiR cassette was highly correlated with simultaneous silencing of Pina\/Sina in the same transgenic plants. High downregulation of Pinb\/Pina genes in T1 plants of wheat and Sinb\/Sina genes in T1 plants of triticale was associated with strong expression of Pinb-derived amiR. Silencing of the target genes correlated with increased grain hardness in both species. Total protein content in the grains of transgenic wheat was significantly lower. Although, the Pinb-derived amiR cassette was stably inherited in the T2 generation of wheat and triticale the silencing effect including strongly decreased expression of silenced genes as well as strong expression of Pinb-derived amiR was not transmitted. Advantages and disadvantages of posttranscriptional silencing of target genes by means of amiR and siRNA-based approaches in polyploid cereals are discussed.\n","915":"\nIntron length polymorphisms (ILPs), a type of gene-based functional marker, could themselves be related to the particular traits. Here, we developed a genome-wide cotton ILPs based on orthologs annotation from two sequenced diploid species, A-genome Gossypium arboreum and D-genome G. raimondii. We identified 10,180 putative ILP markers from 5,021 orthologous genes. Among these, 535 ILP markers from 9 gene families related to stress were selected for experimental verification. Polymorphic rates were 72.71% between G. arboreum and G. raimondii and 36.45% between G. hirsutum acc. TM-1 and G. barbadense cv. Hai7124. Furthermore, 14 polymorphic ILP markers were detected in 264\u00a0G. hirsutum accessions. Coupled with previous simple sequence repeats (SSRs) evaluations and salt tolerance assays from the same individuals, we found a total of 25 marker-trait associations involved in nine ILPs. The nine genes, temporally named as C1 to C9, showed the various expressions in different organs and tissues, and five genes (C3, C4, C5, C7 and C9) were significantly upregulated after salt treatment. We verified that the five genes play important roles in salt tolerance. Particularly, silencing of C4 (encodes WRKY DNA-binding protein) and C9 (encodes Mitogen-activated protein kinase) can significantly enhance cotton susceptibility to salt stress.\n","916":"\nAntibiotic-resistant pathogens claim the lives of thousands of people each year and are currently considered as one of the most serious threats to public health. Apart from clinical environments, soil ecosystems also represent a major source of antibiotic resistance determinants, which can potentially disseminate across distinct microbial habitats and be acquired by human pathogens via horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, it is of global importance to retrieve comprehensive information on environmental factors, contributing to an accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in these ecosystems. Here, medically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, class 1 integrons and IncP-1 plasmids were quantified via real time quantitative PCR in soils derived from temperate grasslands and forests, varying in land use over a large spatial scale. The generated dataset allowed an analysis, decoupled from regional influences, and enabled the identification of land use practices and soil characteristics elevating the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements. In grassland soils, the abundance of the macrolide resistance gene mefA as well as the sulfonamide resistance gene sul2 was positively correlated with organic fertilization and the abundance of aac(6')-lb, conferring resistance to different aminoglycosides, increased with mowing frequency. With respect to forest soils, the beta-lactam resistance gene blaIMP-12 was significantly correlated with fungal diversity which might be due to the fact that different fungal species can produce beta-lactams. Furthermore, except blaIMP-5 and blaIMP-12, the analyzed antibiotic resistance genes as well as IncP-1 plasmids and class-1 integrons were detected less frequently in forest soils than in soils derived from grassland that are commonly in closer proximity to human activities.\n","917":"\nMany species of ladybird beetles (Coccinellidae) possess vivid body colors. These colors and patterns show diversity between coccinellid species, or even within species. However, the molecular underpinnings of these striking body colors are scarcely understood. One of the candidate pigmentation molecules responsible for ladybird body color is ommochrome pigment, which is well known as the red pigment molecule responsible for the red eyes of Drosophila. Various insects also use ommochrome in body coloration. It is known that ommochrome pigment precursors are imported into appropriate cells by the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins White and Scarlet. Thus, these ABC transporter genes are potentially involved in various color and pattern expressions seen in ladybird beetle species. In this study, in order to identify the repertory of ABC transporter genes responsible for such body colors, we performed molecular characterization of pigment-related ABC transporter genes, especially white and scarlet, in the coccinellid Harmonia axyridis. By using whole genome data for H. axyridis and subsequent RACE-PCR, six white orthologs and one scarlet ortholog were successfully identified. According to the results of functional analyses via RNA interference (RNAi), only one of these genes had a major function in eye pigmentation. Specific effects on body color and pattern were not detected by our RNAi experiments of any of these genes. This is the first report of this striking duplication of white genes and their functional analyses in insects.\n","918":"\nSepsis is a life-threatening condition in which an uncontrolled inflammatory host response is triggered. The exact pathogenesis of sepsis remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify key genes that may aid in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. mRNA expression data from blood samples taken from patients with sepsis and healthy individuals was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups were identified. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) network construction, was performed to investigate the function of the identified DEGs. Furthermore, for validation of these results, the expression levels of several DEGs were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative\u2011polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011qPCR) in three patients with sepsis and three healthy blood samples to support the results obtained from the bioinformatics analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were also used to analyze the diagnostic ability of the identified DEGs for sepsis. The results demonstrated that a total of 4,402 DEGs, including 1,960 upregulated and 2,442 downregulated genes, were identified between patients with sepsis and healthy individuals. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 39 DEGs were significantly enriched in toll\u2011like receptor signaling pathways. The top 20 upregulated and downregulated DEGs were used to construct the PPI network. Hub genes with high degrees, including interleukin\u00a01 receptor\u2011associated kinase 3 (IRAK3), S100 calcium\u2011binding protein (S100)A8, angiotensin II receptor\u2011associated protein (AGTRAP) and S100A9, were demonstrated to be associated sepsis. Furthermore, RT\u2011qPCR results demonstrated that IRAK3, adrenomedullin (ADM), arachidonate 5\u2011lipoxygenase (ALOX5), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and S100A8 were significantly upregulated, while ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1) was upregulated but not significantly, in blood samples from patients with sepsis compared with healthy individuals, which was consistent with bioinformatics analysis results. Therefore, AGTRAP, IRAK3, ADM, ALOX5, MMP9, S100A8 and ENTPD1 were identified to have potential diagnostic value in sepsis. In conclusion, dysregulated levels of the AGTRAP, IRAK3, ADM, ALOX5, MMP9, S100A8 and ENTPD1 genes may be involved in sepsis pathophysiology and may be utilized as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets.\n","919":"\nHypoxia is one of the critical environmental stressors for fish in aquatic environments. Although accumulating evidences indicate that gene expression is regulated by hypoxia stress in fish, how genes undergoing differential gene expression and\/or alternative splicing (AS) in response to hypoxia stress in heart are not well understood. Using RNA-seq, we surveyed and detected 289 differential expressed genes (DEG) and 103 genes that undergo differential usage of exons and splice junctions events (DUES) in heart of a hypoxia tolerant fish, Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus following 12h hypoxic treatment. The spatio-temporal expression analysis validated the significant association of differential exon usages in two randomly selected DUES genes (fam162a and ndrg2) in 5 tissues (heart, liver, brain, gill and spleen) sampled at three time points (6h, 12h, and 24h) under acute hypoxia treatment. Functional analysis significantly associated the differential expressed genes with the categories related to energy conservation, protein synthesis and immune response. Different enrichment categories were found between the DEG and DUES dataset. The Isomerase activity, Oxidoreductase activity, Glycolysis and Oxidative stress process were significantly enriched for the DEG gene dataset, but the Structural constituent of ribosome and Structural molecule activity, Ribosomal protein and RNA binding protein were significantly enriched only for the DUES genes. Our comparative transcriptomic analysis reveals abundant stress responsive genes and their differential regulation function in the heart tissues of Nile tilapia under acute hypoxia stress. Our findings will facilitate future investigation on transcriptome complexity and AS regulation during hypoxia stress in fish.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Different transcription factors play critical roles in maintaining the balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis. However, it has been unclear that the genes variants of the transcription factors exert the effects on the imbalance between steogenesis and adipogenesis during the development of ONFH. Here, we selected the 11SNPs from steogenesis, adipogenesis-specific transcription factors RUNX2, Osterix, and PPAR\u03b3 genes, chondrogenesis or adipogenesis key factors COL2A1, IGFBP3 genes and analysed the genotypes, alleles, haplotypes and their association with the risk and clinical phenotypes of ONFH through Mass ARRAY\u00ae platformin in 200 ONFH patients and 177controls. The patients with ONFH (132 males, 68 females; age: 53.46\u00b111.48yr) were consecutively enrolled at the Department of Orthopedics, the Second Clinical College of Jilin University, from March 2014 to June 2015 and were diagnosed and classified into 10 cases of stage II (5.6%), 54 cases of stage III (30.2%) and 115 cases (64.2%) of stage IV and alcohol-induced (71 cases (39.7%)), idiopathic (64 cases (34.0%)), and steroid-induced osteonecrosis (47 cases (26.3%)) subgroup, respectively. Our results showed that all models of logistical regression analysis, the co-dominants, dominants, and recessives of PPAR\u03b3rs2920502, significantly associated with the increased risk of ONFH (p=0.004, p=0.013, p=0.016), respectively. Both the minor homozygous CC genotype and the allele C of rs2920502 were evidently correlated with the enhanced risk of ONFH (p=0.005, p=0.0005),respectively. The recessives models of IGFBP3rs2132572 (G\/A) as well as RUNX2 rs3763190(G\/A) were statistically associated with the higher ONFH risk, p=0.030, p=0.029, respectively; the minor homozygous(AA) of IGFBP3rs2132572 (G\/A) was also related to the increased risk of bilateral hips lesions, p=0.039. Moreover, the ages on set of major homozygous(GG) and heterozygous(GT) of COL2A1rs2070739(G\/A) were significantly younger than that of the minor homozygous(AA) of the SNP(p=0.008) while the A-T-G-A haplotype of COL2A1 gene revealed significant association with the decreased the risk of bilateral hip lesions, p=0.01, OR:0.258. More important, the serum HDL-c level and the ratio of LDL-c\/HDL-c in the ONFH group were significantly decreased and increased compared with those of the control group (p=0.02, p=0.0001), respectively. Particularly, the CC genotype of PPAR\u03b3 rs2920502 was statistically correlated with the enhanced serum TG level, p=0.011.These results suggest that the variants of PPAR\u03b3, RUNX2, COL2A1, and IGFBP3 genes closely associated with the development of ONFH.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017.

The integrative plasmid pSET152ermE was used for the overexpression of orf22, orf41 and orf42 individually. The constructed plasmids were transformed into wild-type strain Streptomyces fungicidicus ATCC 31731. Three gene inactivation mutants \u0394orf22, \u0394orf41 and \u0394orf42 and three recombinant strains overexpressing orf22, orf41 and orf42 were all fermented and the enduracidin production of each strain was detected and compared by HPLC analysis. Two resulting engineered strains were generated through overexpression of gene orf22 and orf42 in Streptomyces fungicidicus, respectively, and in these strains the enduracidins titres were increased by approximately 4\u00b70-fold and 2\u00b73-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain.\nThe functions of three regulatory genes orf22, orf41 and orf42 in the enduracidin gene cluster in Streptomyces fungicidicus ATCC 31731 were examined. The orf22 gene, encoding a SARP family protein, was proposed to act in a positive manner. The proteins encoded by genes orf41 and orf42 were proposed to compose a two-component regulation system, in which the response protein Orf41 was characterized as a repressor, and the kinase Orf42 was shown to be an activator. The production of enduracidins was improved considerably by overexpression of the two positive regulatory genes orf22 and orf42 respectively.\nThe production of enduracidins was successfully improved by manipulating the regulatory genes involving in enduracidin biosynthesis, providing an efficient approach to improve enduracidin production further for fermentation industry and synthetic biological research.\n\u00a9 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.\n","922":"\nThere are extensive long-distance chromosomal interactions in eukaryotic genomes, but to what extent these interactions affect gene expression is not clear.

Microarray datasets of GSE6344, GSE781 and GSE53000 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Using meta-analysis, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between ccRCC and normal samples, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) function analyses. Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and modules were investigated. Furthermore, miRNAs-target gene regulatory network was constructed.\nTotal of 511 up-regulated and 444 down-regulated DEGs were determined in the present gene expression microarray data meta-analysis. These DEGs were enriched in functions like immune system process and pathways like Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. PPI network and eight modules were further constructed. A total of 10 outstanding DEGs including TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein (TYROBP), interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and PPARG co-activator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) were detected in PPI network. Furthermore, the miRNAs-target gene regulation analyses showed that miR-412 and miR-199b respectively targeted IRF7 and PPARGC1A to regulate the immune response in ccRCC.\nTYROBP, IRF7 and PPARGC1A might play important roles in ccRCC via taking part in the immune system process.\nCopyright\u00a9 by Royan Institute.

Identifying characteristic genes of PTC are of great importance to reveal its potential genetic mechanisms. In this paper, we proposed a framework, as well as a measure named Normalized Centrality Measure (NCM), to identify characteristic genes of PTC. The framework consisted of four steps. First, both up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes, collectively called differentially expressed genes (DEGs), were screened and integrated together from four datasets, that is, GSE3467, GSE3678, GSE33630, and GSE58545; second, an interaction network of DEGs was constructed, where each node represented a gene and each edge represented an interaction between linking nodes; third, both traditional measures and the NCM measure were used to analyze the topological properties of each node in the network. Compared with traditional measures, more genes related to PTC were identified by the NCM measure; fourth, by mining the high-density subgraphs of this network and performing Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, several meaningful results were captured, most of which were demonstrated to be associated with PTC. The experimental results proved that this network framework and the NCM measure are useful for identifying more characteristic genes of PTC.\n","925":"\nThe MYB proteins comprise one of the largest transcription factor families in plants, and play key roles in regulatory networks controlling development, metabolism, and stress responses. A total of 125 MYB genes (JcMYB) have been identified in the physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) genome, including 120 2R-type MYB, 4 3R-MYB, and 1 4R-MYB genes. Based on exon-intron arrangement of MYBs from both lower (Physcomitrella patens) and higher (physic nut, Arabidopsis, and rice) plants, we can classify plant MYB genes into ten groups (MI-X), except for MIX genes which are nonexistent in higher plants. We also observed that MVIII genes may be one of the most ancient MYB types which consist of both R2R3- and 3R-MYB genes. Most MYB genes (76.8% in physic nut) belong to the MI group which can be divided into 34 subgroups. The JcMYB genes were nonrandomly distributed on its 11 linkage groups (LGs). The expansion of MYB genes across several subgroups was observed and resulted from genome triplication of ancient dicotyledons and from both ancient and recent tandem duplication events in the physic nut genome. The expression patterns of several MYB duplicates in the physic nut showed differences in four tissues (root, stem, leaf, and seed), and 34 MYB genes responded to at least one abiotic stressor (drought, salinity, phosphate starvation, and nitrogen starvation) in leaves and\/or roots based on the data analysis of digital gene expression tags. Overexpression of the JcMYB001 gene in Arabidopsis increased its sensitivity to drought and salinity stresses. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Targeted deletion of 26 individual candidate genes and seven gene clusters comprising 32 genes of C. graminicola identified a pathogenicity cluster (CLU5) of five co-linear genes, all of which, with the exception of CLU5b, encode secreted proteins. Targeted deletion of all genes of CLU5 revealed that CLU5a and CLU5d are required for full appressorial penetration competence, with virulence deficiencies independent of the host genotype and organ inoculated. Cytorrhysis experiments and microscopy showed that \u0394clu5a mutants form pressurized appressoria, but they are hampered in forming penetration pores and fail to differentiate a penetration peg. Whereas \u0394clu5d mutants elicited WT-like papillae, albeit at increased frequencies, papillae induced by \u0394clu5a mutants were much smaller than those elicited by the WT. Synteny of CLU5 is not only conserved in Colletotrichum spp. but also in additional species of Sordariomycetes including insect pathogens and saprophytes suggesting importance of CLU5 for fungal biology. Since CLU5a and CLU5d also occur in non-pathogenic fungi and since they are expressed prior to plant invasion and even in vegetative hyphae, the encoded proteins probably do not act primarily as effectors.\n\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

To advance gene discovery in prenatal-lethal disorders, we created an easy-to-mine database integrating known human phenotypes with inheritance pattern, scores of genetic constraint, and murine and cellular knockout phenotypes-then critically assessed defining features of known prenatal-lethal genes, among 3187 OMIM genes, and relative to 16,009 non-disease genes. While around one-third (39%) of protein-coding genes are essential for murine development, we curate only 3% (624) of human protein-coding genes linked currently to prenatal\/infantile lethal disorders. 75% prenatal-lethal genes are linked to developmental lethality in knockout mice, compared to 54% for all OMIM genes and 34% among non-disease genes. Genetic constraint correlates with inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive <autosomal dominant <X-linked), and is greatest among prenatal-lethal genes. Importantly, >90% of recessive genes show neither missense nor loss-of-function constraint, even for prenatal-lethal genes. Detailed ontology mapping for 624 prenatal-lethal genes shows marked enrichment among dominant genes for nuclear proteins with roles in RNA\/DNA biology, with recessive genes enriched in cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) metabolic proteins. We conclude that genes without genetic constraint should not be excluded as potential novel disease genes, and especially for recessive conditions (<10% constrained). Prenatal lethal genes are 5.9-fold more likely to be associated with a lethal murine phenotype than non-disease genes. Cell essential genes are largely a subset of mouse-lethal genes, notably under-represented among known OMIM genes, and strong candidates for gamete\/embryo non-viability. We therefore curate 3435 'candidate developmental lethal' human genes: essential for murine development or cellular viability, not yet linked to human disorders, presenting strong candidates for unexplained infertility and prenatal\/infantile mortality.\n","928":"\nSugarcane accumulates very high levels of sucrose in the culm. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that allows such high sucrose synthesis and accumulation (up to 650\u2009mM) is made difficult by the complexity of the highly polyploid genome. Here we report the use of RNA Seq data to characterize the sucrose synthase (SuSy) genes expressed in the transcriptome of the mature sugarcane plant.\nFour SuSy gene families were identified in the sugarcane Iso-Seq long read transcriptome (SUGIT) through gene annotation of transcripts that mapped to reference SuSy genes from sorghum and maize. In total, 38, 19, 14, and 2 transcripts were identified for the four corresponding SuSy genes 1, 2, 4 and 7, respectively. Comparative studies using available SuSy genes from sorghum (1, 2, 4, 6, 7) and maize (1-7) revealed that the sugarcane SuSy genes were interrupted by multiple introns and that they share a highly conserved gene structure. Spatial expression of the four SuSy genes in sugarcane genotypes and in the progenitor species, Saccharum spontaneum and Saccharum officinarum, was studied in the leaf and root tissues and also in three regions of the culm tissue; top, middle and bottom internodes. Expression profiles indicated that all SuSy transcripts were differentially expressed between the top and bottom tissues, with high expression in the top tissues, lower expression in the bottom and moderate expression in the middle, indicating a gradient of SuSy activity in the sugarcane culm. Further, the root tissue had similar expression levels to that of the top internodes while leaf tissues showed lower expression. In the progenitors, SuSy7 was found to be highly expressed in S. officinarum while the other three SuSy genes had moderate expression in both the progenitors.\nThe high expression of the SuSy genes in sink tissues, the top internodes and the roots suggests functional roles in sucrose utilization to support growth. The SuSy7 gene has not been previously reported in sugarcane. As sugarcane is unique in storing such high amounts of sucrose, it is possible that there are more SuSy genes\/isoforms with specific expression patterns to be discovered in this complex system.\n","929":"\nTo explore the potential molecular mechanisms involved in migratory glioma cells.\nThe gene expression profiles of GSE28167, employing human malignant glioma U251MG cells cultured on strictly aligned versus randomly oriented electrospun nanofibers of polycaprolactone, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene differential expression analysis was carried out by the package of Gene Expression Omnibus query and limma in R language. The Gene Set Analysis Toolkit V2 was used for pathway analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to screen for target sites of transcription factors, miRNA and small drug molecules.\nTotally 586 differentially expressed genes were identified and the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in the pathway of muscle cell TarBase, MAPK cascade, adipogenesis and epithelium TarBase. Thirty-two significant target sites of transcription factors, such as hsa_RTAAACA_V$FREAC2_01, were screened. The top 20 potential miRNAs including MIR-124A, MIR-34A and MIR-34C were screened for a constructing gene-miRNA interaction network. Small molecules that can inhibit the motility of glioma cells such as diclofenamide and valinomycin were mined. By integrating the regulatory relationships among transcription factors, miRNAs and differentially expressed genes, we found that 7 differentially expressed genes, including SOX4, ANKRD28 and CCND1, might play crucial roles in the migration of glioma cells.\nThe screened migration-associated genes, significant pathways, and small molecules give us new insight for the mechanism of migratory glioma cells.

From our studies, ACT, UBC, CYP, UBQ and RPL12 as suitable for normalization were identified by geNorm, while UBC and CYP as the best pair by NormFinder. Moreover, UBC was selected as the most stably expressed gene by both algorithms in different Siberian Apricot seed samples. We also detected that a set of three genes (ACT, CYP and UBC) by geNorm as control for normalization could lead to accurate results. Furthermore, the expression levels of oleosin gene were analyzed to validate the suitability of the selected reference genes. These obtained experimental results could make an important contribution to normalize real-time PCR data for gene expression analysis in Siberian Apricot Germplasm. \n","932":"\nLineage-specific duplicated genes likely contribute to the phenotypic divergence in closely related species. However, neither the frequency of duplication events nor the degree of selection pressures immediately after gene duplication is clear in the speciation process. Here, using Illumina DNA-sequencing reads from Arabidopsis halleri, which has multiple closely related species with high-quality genome assemblies (A. thaliana and A. lyrata), we succeeded in generating orthologous gene groups in Brassicaceae. The duplication frequency of retained genes in the Arabidopsis lineage was \u223c10 times higher than the duplication frequency inferred by comparative genomics of Arabidopsis, poplar, rice and moss (Physcomitrella patens). The difference of duplication frequencies can be explained by a rapid decay of anciently duplicated genes. To examine the degree of selection pressure on genes duplicated in either the A. halleri-lyrata or the A. halleri lineage, we examined positive and purifying selection in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages throughout the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (KA\/KS). Duplicate genes tended to have a higher proportion of positive selection compared with non-duplicated genes. Interestingly, we found that functional divergence of duplicated genes was accelerated several million years after gene duplication compared with immediately after gene duplication.\n","933":"\nVarious approaches have been described to infer the gene interaction network from expression data. Several models based on computational and mathematical methods are available. The fundamental thing in the identification of the gene interaction is their biological relevance. Two genes belonging to the same pathway are more likely to affect the expression of each other than the genes of two different pathways. In the present study, interaction network of genes is described based on upregulated genes during neuronal senescence in the Cerebellar granule neurons of rat. We have adopted a supervised learning method and used it in combination with biological pathway information of the genes to develop a gene interaction network. Further modular analysis of the network has been done to identify senescence-related marker genes. Currently there is no adequate information available about the genes implicated in neuronal senescence. Thus identifying multipath genes belonging to the pathway affected by senescence might be very useful in studying the senescence process. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Despite their important roles in reproduction, a comprehensive analysis of RopGEF members has not yet been performed in rice (Oryza sativa). To determine whether RopGEF regulators are involved in rice pollen tube growth, we performed genome-wide analysis of this family in rice.\nPhylogenomic and meta-expression analysis of eleven RopGEFs in rice showed that four genes were preferentially expressed in mature pollen. These four genes contain the plant-specific Rop nucleotide exchanger (PRONE) domain and possible phosphorylated residues, suggesting a conserved role in polar tip growth with Arabidopsis thaliana. In subcellular localization analysis of the four RopGEFs through tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) infiltration, four proteins were predominantly identified in plasma membrane. Moreover, double mutants of RopGEF2\/8 exhibited reduced pollen germination, causing partial male sterility. These genes possess unique cis-acting elements in their promoters compared with the other RopGEF genes.\nIn this study, four RopGEF genes were identified as pollen-specific gene in eleven members of rice, and the expression pattern, promoter analysis, and evolutionary relationship of the RopGEF family were studied compared with Arabidopsis.

One of these genes, fdtE, encodes a novel bifunctional protein with an N-terminal FdtA 3,4-ketoisomerase domain and a C-terminal acetyltransferase domain. KL24 lacks a gene encoding a Wzy polymerase to link the oligosaccharide K units to form the CPS found associated with isolate RCH51, and a wzy gene was found in a small genomic island (GI) near the cpn60 gene.

The CPS isolated from RCH51, studied by sugar analysis and 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, revealed that the K unit has a branched pentasaccharide structure made up of Gal, GalNAc and GlcNAc residues with d-Fuc3NAc as a side branch, and the K units are linked via a \u03b2-d-GlcpNAc-(1\u21923)-\u03b2-d-Galp linkage formed by the Wzy encoded by the GI. The functions of the glycosyltransferases encoded by KL24 were assigned to formation of specific bonds. A correspondence between the order of the genes in KL24 and other KL and the order of the linkages they form was noted, and this may be useful in future predictions of glycosyltransferase specificities.\n","937":"\nKeshan disease (KD) is a kind of endemic cardiomyopathy which has a high mortality. However, molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis of KD remains poorly understood. Serum samples were collected from 112\u2009KD patients and 112 normal controls. Gene microarray was used to screen differently expressed genes. Genevestigator was applied to forecast co-expression genes of significant gene. iTRAQ proteomics analysis was used to verify significant genes and their co-expression genes. GO, COG, IPA and STRING were applied to undertake function categorization, pathway and network analysis separately. We identified 32 differentially expressed genes; IDH2, FEM1A, SSPB1 and their respective 30 co-expression genes; 68 differential proteins in KD. Significant proteins were categorized into 23 biological processes, 16 molecular functions, 16 cellular components, 15 function classes, 13\u2009KD pathways and 1 network. IDH2, FEM1A, SSBP1, CALR, NDUFS2, IDH3A, GAPDH, TCA Cycle II (Eukaryotic) pathway and NADP repair pathway may play important roles in the pathogenesis of KD.\n","938":"\nWe have devised an effective and robust method for the characterization of gene-editing events. The efficacy of editing-mediated mono- and bi-allelic gene inactivation and integration events is quantified based on colony counts. The combination of diphtheria toxin (DT) and puromycin (PM) selection enables analyses of 10,000-100,000 individual cells, assessing hundreds of clones with inactivated genes per experiment. Mono- and bi-allelic gene inactivation is differentiated by DT resistance, which occurs only upon bi-allelic inactivation. PM resistance indicates integration. The robustness and generalizability of the method were demonstrated by quantifying the frequency of gene inactivation and cassette integration under different editing approaches: CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated complete inactivation was ~30-50-fold more frequent than cassette integration. Mono-allelic inactivation without integration occurred >100-fold more frequently than integration. Assessment of gRNA length confirmed 20mers to be most effective length for inactivation, while 16-18mers provided the highest overall integration efficacy. The overall efficacy was ~2-fold higher for CRISPR\/Cas9 than for zinc-finger nuclease and was significantly increased upon modulation of non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. The frequencies and ratios of editing events were similar for two different DPH genes (independent of the target sequence or chromosomal location), which indicates that the optimization parameters identified with this method can be generalized.\n","939":"\nSoybean (Glycine max) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) share a polyploidy event ~59\u00a0MYA, followed by a Glycine-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) ~8-13\u00a0MYA. Duplicated genes were classified into five categories: singletons, dispersed, proximal, tandem, or WGD\/segmental and found strong correlations between gene category and functional annotation. Photosynthesis and transcriptional regulation-related Gene Ontology terms were significantly over-represented in singletons and WGD genes, respectively, aligning with the gene balance hypothesis. We found that the divergence of gene expression and DNA methylation between WGD-derived paralogs increased with age and that WGD genes, initially retained via dosage constraints, subsequently underwent expression divergence, associated with other factors such as DNA methylation. Genes derived from different modes of duplication differed in breadth, level, and specificity of expression in both species. Orthologous genes and ungrouped genes (genes not in an ortholog group) differed in expression patterns. The protein divergence rates of WGD paralog pairs containing an ungrouped gene were higher than those for which both copies had orthologs. We propose that many ungrouped genes are derived from divergent and redundant gene copies, concordant with the neofunctionalization hypothesis. Tandemly duplicated genes were distinct from WGD-derived genes, indicating that mode of duplication contributes to the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes.\n\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n","940":"\nGenome comparisons between closely related species often show non-conserved regions across chromosomes. Some of them are located in specific regions of chromosomes and some are even confined to one or more entire chromosomes. The origin and biological relevance of these non-conserved regions are still largely unknown. Here we used the genome of Fusarium graminearum to elucidate the significance of non-conserved regions.\nThe genome of F. graminearum harbours thirteen non-conserved regions dispersed over all of the four chromosomes. Using RNA-Seq data from the mycelium of F. graminearum, we found weakly expressed regions on all of the four chromosomes that exactly matched with non-conserved regions. Comparison of gene expression between two different developmental stages (conidia and mycelium) showed that the expression of genes in conserved regions is stable, while gene expression in non-conserved regions is much more influenced by developmental stage. In addition, genes involved in the production of secondary metabolites and secreted proteins are enriched in non-conserved regions, suggesting that these regions could also be important for adaptations to new environments, including adaptation to new hosts. Finally, we found evidence that non-conserved regions are generated by sequestration of genes from multiple locations. Gene relocations may lead to clustering of genes with similar expression patterns or similar biological functions, which was clearly exemplified by the PKS2 gene cluster.\nOur results showed that chromosomes can be functionally divided into conserved and non-conserved regions, and both could have specific and distinct roles in genome evolution and regulation of gene expression.\n","941":"\nThe rapid development and increase of antibiotic resistance are global phenomena resulting from the extensive use of antibiotics in human clinics and animal feeding operations. Antibiotics can promote the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which can be transferred horizontally to humans and animals through water and the food chain. In this study, the presence and abundance of ARGs in livestock waste was monitored by quantitative PCR. A diverse set of bacteria and tetracycline resistance genes encoding ribosomal protection proteins (RPPs) from three livestock farms and a river were analyzed through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The abundance of sul(I) was 103 to 105 orders of magnitude higher than that of sul(II). Among 11 tet-ARGs, the most abundant was tet(O). The results regarding bacterial diversity indicated that the presence of antibiotics might have an evident impact on bacterial diversity at every site, particularly at the investigated swine producer. The effect of livestock waste on the bacterial diversity of soil was stronger than that of water. Furthermore, a sequencing analysis showed that tet(M) exhibited two genotypes, while the other RPPs-encoding genes exhibited at least three genotypes. This study showed that various ARGs and RPPs-encoding genes are particularly widespread among livestock.\n","942":"\nThe MADS-box gene family encodes transcription factors and plays an important role in plant growth and the development of flower and fruit. A perennial dioecious plant, the red bayberry genome has been published recently, providing the opportunity to analyze the MADS-box gene family and its role in fruit development and ripening. Here, we identified 54 MADS-box genes in the red bayberry genome, and classified them into two types based on phylogenetic analysis. Thirteen Type I MADS-box genes were subdivided into three subfamilies and 41 Type II MADS-box genes into 13 subfamilies. A total of 46 MADS-box genes were distributed across eight red bayberry chromosomes, and the other eight genes were located on the unmapped scaffolds. Transcriptome analysis suggested that the expression of most Type II genes was higher than Type I in five female tissues. Moreover, 26 MADS-box genes were expressed during red bayberry fruit development and ten of them showed high expression. qRT-PCR showed that the expression of MrMADS01 (SEP, MIKCC), with differences between the pale pink and red varieties, increased significantly at the final ripening stage, suggesting it may participate in ripening as positive regulator and related to anthocyanin biosynthesis. These results provide some clues for future study of MADS-box genes in red bayberry, especially in ripening process.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By implementing three distinct algorithms (geNorm, normFinder and BestKeeper), we have validated the stability of the expression of seven candidate reference genes in tartary buckwheat, including FtSAND, FtCACS, FtExpressed1, FtGAPDH, FtActin, FtEF-1a and FtH3. In this study, the results indicated that FtCACS and FtSAND were the best reference genes for 'abiotic cotyledons', FtExpressed1 and FtEF-1\u03b1 were the best reference genes for aluminium treatment, FtCACS and FtExpressed1 performed the best for the immature seed stage, FtCACS was best for the abiotic treatment, and FtH3 appeared to be the most suitable reference gene for the abiotic treatment in hypocotyls and all samples in this study. In contrast, FtActin and FtGAPDH are unsuitable genes. Our findings offer additional stable reference genes for gene expression research on tartary buckwheat at the immature seed stage and under abiotic treatment.\n","944":"\nAs other legume crops, alfalfa cultivation increases the emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Since legume-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria play a crucial role in this emission, it is important to understand the possible impacts of rhizobial domestication on the evolution of denitrification genes. In comparison with the genomes of non-commercial strains, those of commercial alfalfa inoculants exhibit low total genome size, low number of ORFs and high numbers of both frameshifted genes and pseudogenes, suggesting a dramatic loss of genes during bacterial domestication. Genomic analysis focused on denitrification genes revealed that commercial strains have perfectly conserved the nitrate (NAP), nitrite (NIR) and nitric (NOR) reductase clusters related to the production of N2O from nitrate but completely lost the nitrous oxide (NOS) reductase cluster (nosRZDFYLX genes) associated with the reduction of N2O to gas nitrogen. Based on these results, we propose future screenings for alfalfa-nodulating isolates containing both nitrogen fixation and N2O reductase genes for environmental sustainability of alfalfa production.\n","945":"\nThe biotrophic fungus, Erysiphe pisi is the chief causal agent of powdery mildew disease of garden pea. A genome-wide search using in-silico approach was carried to detect putative pathogenicity and virulence genes of E. pisi, since information about these genes and their interaction with pea is limited. Nineteen putative pathogenicity gene sequences were detected through genome-wide pathogenicity gene-search and confirmed them to be conserved in E. pisi through genomic PCRs. Fifteen of these genes expressed through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplifying expected band size along with fungal and plant specific internal controls. Gene sequencing and annotation revealed them to be Erysiphe-specific. A time course study was carried to monitor expression of nine of these genes through real-time quantitative (qRT)-PCR in Erysiphe-challenged plants of powdery mildew resistant pea genotype, JI-2480 carrying er2 gene and susceptible pea cultivar, Arkel. Expression of these genes was differentially and temporally regulated. They were found mostly related to signaling; cAMP-PKA (cPKA, CRP and AC) and MAPK (MST7) pathways along with MFP, TRE and PEX which are reported pathogenicity factors in other ascomycete members indicating that similar conserved pathways function in E. pisi also. These genes expressed at higher level at initial hours post inoculation (hpi) as early as 6 hpi in Arkel compared to JI-2480 implying them as pathogenicity factors. The elevated level of expression of MFP, TRE, CRP and cPKA gene sequences in E. pisi-challenged JI-2480 genotype at 12 hpi alone suggests these genes to possess a role in avirulence in JI-2480, conferring er2 mediated resistance.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Selection of suitable reference genes for quantification of target gene expression is important for the discovery of molecular mechanisms underlying improved growth traits and stress tolerance. The stability of nine potential reference genes (ACT, TUB, EF1a, GAPDH, SAND, CACS, F-box, PEPKR1 and TIP41) was evaluated using four programs, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The combinations of SAND and TUB or TIP41 and TUB were most stably expressed in salt-treated roots or leaves. The combinations of GAPDH with TIP41 or TUB were stable in roots and leaves under drought stress. TIP41 and PEPKR1 exhibited stable expression in cold-treated roots, and the combination of F-box, TIP41 and TUB was also stable in cold-treated leaves. CACS and TUB were the two most stable reference genes in heat-stressed roots. TIP41 combined with TUB and ACT was stably expressed in heat-stressed leaves. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays of the target gene FaWRKY1 using the identified most stable reference genes confirmed the reliability of selected reference genes. The selection of suitable reference genes in tall fescue will allow for more accurate identification of stress-tolerance genes and molecular mechanisms conferring stress tolerance in this stress-tolerant species. \n","947":"\nDiabetes is an autoimmunologic disease that may have a different background. The aim of our study was to show that type 1 diabetes is accompanied by changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We analyzed the genes characteristic of pancreatic islet cells and genes playing a big part in autoimmune diseases and cancer.\nThe study included 21 patients and was performed to examine the expression of 9 genes. The patients were divided into 3 research groups: people with type 1 diabetes, people with diabetes after pancreas transplant, and a control group of healthy patients. To assess the level of expression, RNA material was obtained from peripheral blood collected from individuals qualified for the study.\nThe results of the study showed many interesting changes in the expression level of the analyzed genes. It was demonstrated that CASR gene expression was significantly higher in transplant patients than in diabetic patients. Differences in the level of activity are also noted in genes that take part in autoimmune diseases.\nProfiling gene expression in peripheral blood samples may be a useful and noninvasive diagnostic tool that allows early detection of changes leading to the onset or resumption of diabetes.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Detecting synergic genes is more difficult than selecting individually discriminant genes. Several efforts have recently been made to detect gene-gene synergies, such as dendrogram-based I(X 1; X 2; Y) (mutual information), doublets (gene pairs) and MIC(X 1; X 2; Y) based on the maximal information coefficient. It is unclear whether dendrogram-based I(X 1; X 2; Y) and doublets can capture synergies efficiently. Although MIC(X 1; X 2; Y) can capture a wide range of interaction, it has a high computational cost triggered by its 3-D search. In this paper, we developed a simple and fast approach based on abs conversion type (i.e. Z\u2009=\u2009|X 1\u2009-\u2009X 2|) and t-test, to detect interactions in simulation and real-world datasets. Our results showed that dendrogram-based I(X 1; X 2; Y) and doublets are helpless for discovering pair-wise gene interactions, our approach can discover typical pair-wise synergic genes efficiently. These synergic genes can reach comparable accuracy to the individually discriminant genes using the same number of genes. Classifier cannot learn well if synergic genes have not been converted properly. Combining individually discriminant and synergic genes can improve the prediction performance.\n","949":"\nPerennial tree Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen could form the precious heartwood used to produce chinese traditional medicine, rosewood furniture and fragrances. However the formation of heartwood is time-consuming and low efficient, leading to the severe destruction of its wild resources. Thus, it is urgent to study the molecular mechanism of heartwood formation in D. odorifera. But till now, there is no report about the reference gene selection in this species. In this study, the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes were evaluated across different tissues and stems treated by wound and chemical stimulators. Four algorithms were applied to obtain the robust genes. The results support HIS2, GAPDH, and CYP to be the most stable reference genes in samples under different wound treatments while DNAj was the least stable. In different tissues, HIS2, UBQ, and RPL were the most stable reference genes while DNAj was the least stable. The selected reference genes were validated through the normalization of the qRT-PCR data of six heartwood related genes in terpene biosynthesis pathway and ethylene signal pathway. The results showed that their expression levels were accurate when they were normalized by the most stable reference gene HIS2, or by the combination of the two or three most stable reference genes. These results demonstrated that these selected reference genes are reliable.\n","950":"\nHomeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) transcription factors play important roles in the growth, development and stress responses of plants, including (presumably) physic nut (Jatropha curcas), which has high drought and salinity tolerance. However, although physic nut's genome has been released, there is little knowledge of the functions, expression profiles and evolutionary histories of the species' HD-ZIP genes.\nIn this study, 32 HD-ZIP genes were identified in the physic nut genome (JcHDZs) and divided into four groups (I-IV) based on phylogenetic analysis with homologs from rice, maize and Arabidopsis. The analysis also showed that most of the JcHDZ genes were closer to members from Arabidopsis than to members from rice and maize. Of the 32 JcHDZ genes, most showed differential expression patterns among four tissues (root, stem cortex, leaf, and seed). Expression profile analysis based on RNA-seq data indicated that 15 of the JcHDZ genes respond to at least one abiotic stressor (drought and\/or salinity) in leaves at least at one time point. Transient expression of a JcHDZ16-YFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts cells showed that JcHDZ16 is localized in the nucleus. In addition, rice seedlings transgenically expressing JcHDZ16 had lower proline contents and activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) together with higher relative electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde contents under salt stress conditions (indicating higher sensitivity) than wild-type plants. The transgenic seedlings also showed increased sensitivity to exogenous ABA, and increases in the transcriptional abundance of several salt stress-responsive genes were impaired in their responses to salt stress. Further data on JcHDZ16-overexpressing plants subjected to salt stress treatment verified the putative role of JcHDZ genes in salt stress responses.\nOur results may provide foundations for further investigation of functions of JcHDZ genes in responses to abiotic stress, and promote application of JcHDZ genes in physic nut breeding.\n","951":"\nLong terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-Rs) are major elements creating new genome structure for expansion of plant genomes. However, in addition to the genome expansion, the role of LTR-Rs has been unexplored. In this study, we constructed new reference genome sequences of two pepper species (Capsicum baccatum and C. chinense), and updated the reference genome of C. annuum. We focused on the study for speciation of Capsicum spp. and its driving forces. We found that chromosomal translocation, unequal amplification of LTR-Rs, and recent gene duplications in the pepper genomes as major evolutionary forces for diversification of Capsicum spp. Specifically, our analyses revealed that the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat proteins (NLRs) were massively created by LTR-R-driven retroduplication. These retoduplicated NLRs were abundant in higher plants, and most of them were lineage-specific. The retroduplication was a main process for creation of functional disease-resistance genes in Solanaceae plants. In addition, 4-10% of whole genes including highly amplified families such as MADS-box and cytochrome P450 emerged by the retroduplication in the plants. Our study provides new insight into creation of disease-resistance genes and high-copy number gene families by retroduplication in plants.

Therefore, there is an urgent need in screening key biomarkers of HCC to predict the prognosis and develop more individual treatments. Recently, AATF is reported to be an important factor contributing to HCC.\nWe aimed to establish a gene signature to predict overall survival of HCC patients. Firstly, we examined the expression level of AATF in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the International Union of Cancer Genome (ICGC) databases. Genes coexpressed with AATF were identified in the TCGA dataset by the Poisson correlation coefficient and used to establish a gene signature for survival prediction. The prognostic significance of this gene signature was then validated in the ICGC dataset and used to build a combined prognostic model for clinical practice.\nGene expression data and clinical information of 2521 HCC patients were downloaded from three public databases. AATF expression in HCC tissue was higher than that in matched normal liver tissues. 644 genes coexpressed with AATF were identified by the Poisson correlation coefficient and used to establish a three-gene signature (KIF20A, UCK2, and SLC41A3) by the univariate and multivariate least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression analyses. This three-gene signature was then used to build a combined nomogram for clinical practice.\nThis integrated nomogram based on the three-gene signature can predict overall survival for HCC patients well. The three-gene signature may be a potential therapeutic target in HCC.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Jun Liu et al.\n","953":"\nGenetic evidence for a link between DNA replication and glycolysis has been demonstrated a decade ago in Bacillus subtilis, where temperature-sensitive mutations in genes coding for replication proteins could be suppressed by mutations in genes of glycolytic enzymes. Then, a strong influence of dysfunctions of particular enzymes from the central carbon metabolism (CCM) on DNA replication and repair in Escherichia coli was reported. Therefore, we asked if such a link occurs only in bacteria or it is a more general phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate that effects of silencing (provoked by siRNA) of expression of genes coding for proteins involved in DNA replication and repair (primase, DNA polymerase \u03b9, ligase IV, and topoisomerase III\u03b2) on these processes (less efficient entry into the S phase of the cell cycle and decreased level of DNA synthesis) could be suppressed by silencing of specific genes of enzymes from CMM. Silencing of other pairs of replication\/repair and CMM genes resulted in enhancement of the negative effects of lower expression levels of replication\/repair genes. We suggest that these results may be proposed as a genetic evidence for the link between DNA replication\/repair and CMM in human cells, indicating that it is a common biological phenomenon, occurring from bacteria to humans.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas the distribution of these enzymes in cyanobacteria and land plants is well understood, the presence, loss, duplication, and replacement of these genes have not been surveyed in the polyphyletic and remarkably diverse eukaryotic algal lineages.\nA phylogenetic reconstruction of the history of the POR enzyme (encoded by the por gene in nuclei) in eukaryotic algae reveals replacement and supplementation of ancestral por genes in several taxa with horizontally transferred por genes from other eukaryotic algae. For example, stramenopiles and haptophytes share por gene duplicates of prasinophytic origin, although their plastid ancestry predicts a rhodophytic por signal. Phylogenetically, stramenopile pors appear ancestral to those found in haptophytes, suggesting transfer from stramenopiles to haptophytes by either horizontal or endosymbiotic gene transfer. In dinoflagellates whose plastids have been replaced by those of a haptophyte or diatom, the ancestral por genes seem to have been lost whereas those of the new symbiotic partner are present. Furthermore, many chlorarachniophytes and peridinin-containing dinoflagellates possess por gene duplicates. In contrast to the retention, gain, and frequent duplication of algal por genes, the LIPOR gene complement (chloroplast-encoded chlL, chlN, and chlB genes) is often absent. LIPOR genes have been lost from haptophytes and potentially from the euglenid and chlorarachniophyte lineages. Within the chlorophytes, rhodophytes, cryptophytes, heterokonts, and chromerids, some taxa possess both POR and LIPOR genes while others lack LIPOR. The gradual process of LIPOR gene loss is evidenced in taxa possessing pseudogenes or partial LIPOR gene compliments. No horizontal transfer of LIPOR genes was detected.\nWe document a pattern of por gene acquisition and expansion as well as loss of LIPOR genes from many algal taxa, paralleling the presence of multiple por genes and lack of LIPOR genes in the angiosperms. These studies present an opportunity to compare the regulation and function of por gene families that have been acquired and expanded in patterns unique to each of various algal taxa.\n","955":"\nAtrijuglans hetaohei Yang (Lepidoptera: Gelechioidea), is one of the major pests that can seriously damage the walnut fruits. Neuropeptides and their receptors regulate most physiological functions in insects and represent new targets for the development of control agents. To identify the neuropeptides and their receptors from A. hetaohei, we sequenced and analyzed its head transcriptomic data, identified 32 neuropeptides and 39 neuropeptide receptor genes. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses suggest that A. hetaohei neuropeptides and receptor genes have high homology with those in Bombyx mori, Chilo suppressalis, Plutella xylostella and Helicoverpa armigera. Moreover, gene expression patterns revealed that neuropeptide genes such as AKH1, CP, MS and PTTH were expressed specifically in male head, while CAP3, DH, NPLP1, PBAN and SIF showed higher expression in the female head. Bur showed abdomen biased expression in both male and female. Neuropeptide receptor genes such as A8, A11, A15 and LGR were highly expressed in male head, whereas A24 and LGR2 were preferentially expressed in female head. This is the first sequencing, identification and expression analyses of neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptor genes from A. hetaohei. Our results could provide a powerful background that will facilitate the further investigations using transcriptomics to determine neuropeptides and their receptors presence, functions, and indicates potential targets in A. hetaohei for a novel pest management strategy.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Physiologic heme degradation can be catalyzed by two isozymes of HO (HO-1 and HO-2). In fish, the molecular constructions, expression characteristics and hypoxic regulation of HO-2 are still not well known. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of duplicated HO-2 genes in blunt snout bream, a hypoxia sensitive fish species. Blunt snout bream HO-2a and -2b genes shared a relatively low sequence identity of 67%. The HO-2a and -2b mRNAs were widely expressed in adult tissues. During embryogenesis, HO-2a mRNAs was significantly upregulated at 16hpf and then maintained with high lever, while HO-2b mRNAs was gradually increased at 12hpf and then reduced significantly. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that HO-2a and -2b mRNAs mainly detected in brain and eyes at different embryonic stages. The results of acute hypoxia experiment showed that both HO-2a and -2b mRNAs have significant changes in different tissues. Both HO-2a and -2b mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in the brain, but down-regulated in the gill and liver during hypoxia. Under hypoxia, HO-2a mRNA in the heart was significantly increased while HO-2b mRNA was decreased. Embryos in hypoxic conditions at different developmental stages strongly induced the mRNA expression of HO-2a and -2b. These results provide new insights into the functional conservation and divergence of HO-2 genes and improve our understanding of HO-2 responses to hypoxia.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017.

It maintains its metabolic functions due to the contribution of different signaling pathways. However, several factors play a role in its deterioration, allowing to the development of osteoarthritis (OA), and one of the major factors is genetic. Our goal was to identify gene-gene interactions (epistasis) between five signaling pathways involved in the articular cartilage metabolism as possible indicators of OA risk. We applied the Multifactor-Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method to identify and characterize the epistasis between 115 SNPs located in 73 genes related to HIF-1\u03b1, Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin, cartilage extracellular matrix metabolism, oxidative stress, and uric acid transporters. Ninety three patients diagnosed with primary knee OA and 150 healthy controls were included in the study. Genotyping was performed with the OpenArray system, the statistical analysis was carried out with the STATA software v14, and epistasis was analyzed with the MDR software v3.0.2. The MDR analysis revealed that the best interaction model was between polymorphisms rs17786744 of the STC1 gene and rs2615977 of the COL11A1 gene, with an entropy value of 4.44%, CVC 8\/10, OR 5.60, 95% CI 3.27-9.59, p\u2009<\u20090.0001.

The expression of the identified key genes was confirmed in AD transgenic mice through using qRT-PCR.\nTwo modules were found to be associated with AD clinical severity, which functioning mainly in mineral absorption, NF-\u03baB signaling, and cGMP-PKG signaling pathways. Through analysis of the two modules, we found that metallothionein (MT), Notch2, MSX1, ADD3, and RAB31 were highly correlated with AD phenotype. Increase in expression of these genes was confirmed in aged AD transgenic mice.\nWGCNA analysis can be used to analyze and predict the key genes in AD.

Consequently, over time many cave-adapted species downregulate the expression of vision genes or even lose their eyes and associated eye genes entirely. Alternatively, organisms that live in fluctuating environments, with different requirements for vision at different times, may evolve phenotypic plasticity for expression of vision genes. Here, we use a global transcriptomic and candidate gene approach to compare gene expression in the heads of a polyphenic butterfly. Bicyclus anynana have two seasonal forms that display sexual dimorphism and plasticity in eye morphology, and female-specific plasticity in opsin gene expression. Nonchoosy dry season females downregulate opsin expression, consistent with the high physiological cost of vision. To identify other genes associated with sexually dimorphic and seasonally plastic differences in vision, we analyzed RNA-sequencing data from whole head tissues. We identified two eye development genes (klarsicht and warts homologs) and an eye pigment biosynthesis gene (henna) differentially expressed between seasonal forms. By comparing sex-specific expression across seasonal forms, we found that klarsicht, warts, henna, and another eye development gene (domeless) were plastic in a female-specific manner. In a male-only analysis, white (w) was differentially expressed between seasonal forms. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that warts and white are expressed in eyes only, whereas klarsicht, henna and domeless are expressed in both eyes and brain. We find that differential expression of eye development and eye pigment genes is associated with divergent eye phenotypes in B. anynana seasonal forms, and that there is a larger effect of season on female vision-related genes.\n\u00a9 The Author 2015.

Nimrod genes show blood cell specific expression and code for phagocytosis receptors that play a major role in fruit fly innate immune functions. We previously identified three homologous genes (vajk-1, vajk-2 and vajk-3) located within the Nimrod cluster, which are unrelated to the Nimrod genes, but are homologous to a fourth gene (vajk-4) located outside the cluster. Here we show that, unlike the Nimrod candidates, the Vajk proteins are expressed in cuticular structures of the late embryo and the late pupa, indicating that they contribute to cuticular barrier functions.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is caused by one species, Blumeria graminis, which is divided into formae speciales each of which is highly specialized to one host. Recently, a new form capable of growing on triticale (B.g. triticale) has emerged through hybridization between wheat and rye mildews (B.g. tritici and B.g. secalis, respectively). In this work, we used RNA sequencing to study the molecular basis of host adaptation in B.g. triticale. We analyzed gene expression in three B.g. tritici isolates, two B.g. secalis isolates and two B.g. triticale isolates and identified a core set of putative effector genes that are highly expressed in all formae speciales. We also found that the genes differentially expressed between isolates of the same form as well as between different formae speciales were enriched in putative effectors. Their coding genes belong to several families including some which contain known members of mildew avirulence (Avr) and suppressor (Svr) genes. Based on these findings we propose that effectors play an important role in host adaptation that is mechanistically based on Avr-Resistance gene-Svr interactions. We also found that gene expression in the B.g. triticale hybrid is mostly conserved with the parent-of-origin, but some genes inherited from B.g. tritici showed a B.g. secalis-like expression. Finally, we identified 11 unambiguous cases of putative effector genes with hybrid-specific, non-parent of origin gene expression, and we propose that they are possible determinants of host specialization in triticale mildew. These data suggest that altered expression of multiple effector genes, in particular Avr and Svr related factors, might play a role in mildew host adaptation based on hybridization.\n","962":"\nChemical senses serve a multitude of essential functions across the animal kingdom. Vertebrates employ four GPCR families to detect odors, among them the v1r\/ora gene family. The V1R family is known to evolve rapidly in the lobe-finned lineage giving rise to tetrapods, but the homologous ORA family consists of just six highly conserved genes in teleost fish, with direct orthologs in the lobe-finned fish coelacanth. Thus, the teleost repertoire of six canonical ora genes was assumed to be the ancestral feature before the divergence of ray-finned and lobe-finned fish. So far, this hypothesis has not been tested with earlier diverging ray-finned fish.\nWe have newly identified the complete ora gene repertoires of five teleost species, and of spotted gar, a basal ray-finned fish, using thorough data mining and extensive phylogenetic analysis. The genomes of eight further teleost species were re-analyzed for their ORA repertoires. We report that direct orthologs of the six canonical ora genes (ora1-6) were present in all newly analyzed species, with faithfully preserved exon\/intron structure and mostly preserved genomic arrangement in symmetric pairs for ora1-4. In four teleost species including medaka and cave fish we observe species-specific gene duplication events. Thus, the ora gene repertoire in teleost fish is not quite as strictly conserved as previously assumed. In fact, the examination of non-synonymous vs. synonymous substitution rates (dN\/dS) shows pronounced negative selection in five of the six ora genes, but also rare occurrence of positive selection in ora3 and ora6. Surprisingly, spotted gar possesses beyond the six canonical genes three additional genes, ora7-8b, orthologous to coelacanth genes v1r07-10. No orthologs for these genes were found in teleosts and cartilaginous fish.\nEarly diverging ray-finned fish such as the spotted gar possess several v1r-like genes previously assumed to be restricted to the lobe-finned lineage, but now found to be already present in the most recent common ancestor of lobe- and ray-finned fish. Thus, the presence of just six canonical ora genes in many teleost species is not the ancestral feature of the ray-finned lineage, but caused by loss of two ancestral genes in teleosts.\n","963":"\nGastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers with high mortality globally. However, the molecular mechanisms of GC are unclear, and the prognosis of GC is poor. Therefore, it is important to explore the underlying mechanisms and screen for novel prognostic markers and treatment targets.\nThe genetic and clinical data of GC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Modules with clinical significance and preservation were distinguished, and gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis were performed. Hub genes of these modules were validated in the TCGA dataset and another independent dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database by t-test. Furthermore, the significance of these genes was confirmed via survival analysis.\nWe found a preserved module consisting of 506 genes was associated with clinical traits including pathologic T stage and histologic grade. PDGFRB, COL8A1, EFEMP2, FBN1, EMILIN1, FSTL1 and KIRREL were identified as candidate genes in the module. Their expression levels were correlated with pathologic T stage and histologic grade, also affected overall survival of GC patients.\nThese candidate genes may be involved in proliferation and differentiation of GC cells. They may serve as novel prognostic markers and treatment targets. Moreover, most of them were first reported in GC and deserved further research.\n","964":"\nRecent advancement in bioinformatics offers the ability to identify informative genes from high dimensional gene expression data. Selection of informative genes from these large datasets has emerged as an issue of major concern among researchers.\nGene functionality and regulatory mechanisms can be understood through the analysis of these gene expression data. Here, we present a computational method to identify informative genes for breast cancer subtypes such as Basal, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2), luminal A (LumA), and luminal B (LumB).\nThe proposed In Silico Markers method is a wrapper feature selection method based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. Moreover, the composite measure consisting of relevance, redundancy, and rank score of frequently appeared genes are used to select informative genes.\nThe informative genes are validated by statistical and biologically relevant criteria. For a comparative evaluation of the proposed approach, biological similarity score designed on semantic similarity measure of GO terms are investigated. Further, the proposed technique is evaluated with 7 existing gene selection techniques using two-class annotated breast cancer subtype datasets.\nThe utilization of this method can bring about the discovery of informative genes. Furthermore, under multiple criteria decision-making set-up, informative genes selected by the In Silico Markers are found to be admirable than the compared methods selected genes.\n","965":"\nUp to 50% of lupus nephritis (LN) patients experience renal flares after their initial episode of LN. These flares contribute to poor renal outcomes. We postulated that intrarenal immune gene expression is different in flares compared with de novo LN, and conducted these studies to test this hypothesis.\nGlomerular and tubulointerstitial immune gene expression was evaluated in 14 patients who had a kidney biopsy to diagnose LN and another biopsy at their first LN flare. Ten healthy living kidney donors were included as controls. RNA was extracted from laser microdissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded kidney biopsies. Gene expression was analyzed using the Nanostring nCounter\u00ae platform and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Panther Gene Ontology tools.\nOver 110 genes were differentially expressed between LN and healthy control kidney biopsies. Although there was considerable molecular heterogeneity between LN biopsies at diagnosis and flare, for about half the LN patients gene expression from the first LN biopsy clustered with the repeated LN biopsy. However, in all patients, a set of eight interferon alpha-controlled genes had a significantly higher expression in the diagnostic biopsy compared with the flare biopsy. In contrast, nine tumor necrosis factor alpha-controlled genes had higher expression in flare biopsies.\nThere is significant heterogeneity in immune-gene expression of kidney tissue from LN patients. There are limited but important differences in gene expression between LN flares, which may influence treatment decisions.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

Compared to white feather broiler breeds, Chinese local broiler breeds have a slow growth rate. The main genes affecting the growth traits of local chickens in China are still unclear and need to be further explored. This experiment used fast-growth and slow-growth groups of the Jinghai Yellow chicken as the research objects. Three males and three females with similar body weights were selected from the two groups at four weeks old and eight weeks old, respectively, with a total of 24 individuals selected. After slaughter, their chest muscles were taken for transcriptome sequencing. In the differentially expressed genes screening, all of the genes obtained were screened by fold change \u2265 2 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. For four-week-old chickens, a total of 172 differentially expressed genes were screened in males, where there were 68 upregulated genes and 104 downregulated genes in the fast-growth group when compared with the slow-growth group. A total of 31 differentially expressed genes were screened in females, where there were 11 upregulated genes and 20 downregulated genes in the fast-growth group when compared with the slow-growth group. For eight-week-old chickens, a total of 37 differentially expressed genes were screened in males. The fast-growth group had 28 upregulated genes and 9 downregulated genes when compared with the slow-growth group. A total of 44 differentially expressed genes were screened in females. The fast-growth group had 13 upregulated genes and 31 downregulated genes when compared with the slow-growth group. Through gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, many genes were found to be related to cell proliferation and differentiation, muscle growth, and cell division such as SNCG, MCL1, ARNTL, PLPPR4, VAMP1, etc. Real-time PCR results were consistent with the RNA-Seq data and validated the findings. The results of this study will help to understand the regulation mechanism of the growth and development of Jinghai Yellow chicken and provide a theoretical basis for improving the growth rate of Chinese local chicken breeds.\n","967":"\nThe plastids of chlorarachniophytes were derived from an ancestral green alga via secondary endosymbiosis. Thus, genes from the \"green\" lineage via secondary endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) are expected in the nuclear genomes of the Chlorarachniophyta. However, several recent studies have revealed the presence of \"red\" genes in their nuclear genomes. To elucidate the origin of such \"red\" genes in chlorarachniophyte nuclear genomes, we carried out exhaustive single-gene phylogenetic analyses, including two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that represent two divergent sister lineages of the Chlorarachniophyta, Amorphochlora amoeboformis (\u200a=\u200aLotharella amoeboformis; based on RNA sequences newly determined here) and Bigelowiella natans (based on the published genome sequence). We identified 10 genes of cyanobacterial origin, phylogenetic analysis of which showed the chlorarachniophytes to branch with the red lineage (red algae and\/or red algal secondary or tertiary plastid-containing eukaryotes). Of the 10 genes, 7 demonstrated robust monophyly of the two chlorarachniophyte OTUs. Thus, the common ancestor of the extant chlorarachniophytes likely experienced multiple horizontal gene transfers from the red lineage. Because 4 of the 10 genes are obviously photosynthesis- and\/or plastid-related, and almost all of the eukaryotic OTUs in the 10 trees possess plastids, such red genes most likely originated directly from photosynthetic eukaryotes. This situation could be explained by a possible cryptic endosymbiosis of a red algal plastid before the secondary endosymbiosis of the green algal plastid, or a long-term feeding on a single (or multiple closely related) red algal plastid-containing eukaryote(s) after the green secondary endosymbiosis. \n","968":"\nWe performed phylogenetic analyses of HBG genes to assess its origin and interspecific variation among primates. Our analyses showed variation in HBG genes copy number ranging from one to three, some of them pseudogenes. For platyrrhines HBG genes, phylogenetic reconstructions of flanking regions recovered orthologous clades with distinct topologies for 5' and 3' flanking regions. The 5' region originated in the common ancestor of platyrrhines but the 3' region had an anthropoid origin. We hypothesize that the platyrrhine HBG genes of 5' and 3' heterophyletic origins arose from subsequent fusions of the (earlier) platyrrhine 5' portion and the (later) anthropoid 3' portion.\n","969":"\nMaize (Zea mays L.), a model species for genetic studies, is one of the two most important crop species worldwide. The genome sequence of the reference genotype, B73, representative of the stiff stalk heterotic group was recently updated (AGPv4) using long-read sequencing and optical mapping technology. To facilitate the use of AGPv4 and to enable functional genomic studies and association of genotype with phenotype, we determined expression abundances for replicated mRNA-sequencing datasets from 79 tissues and five abiotic\/biotic stress treatments revealing 36\u00a0207 expressed genes. Characterization of the B73 transcriptome across six organs revealed 4154 organ-specific and 7704 differentially expressed (DE) genes following stress treatment. Gene co-expression network analyses revealed 12 modules associated with distinct biological processes containing 13\u00a0590 genes providing a resource for further association of gene function based on co-expression patterns. Presence-absence variants (PAVs) previously identified using whole genome resequencing data from 61 additional inbred lines were enriched in organ-specific and stress-induced DE genes suggesting that PAVs may function in phenological variation and adaptation to environment. Relative to core genes conserved across the 62 profiled inbreds, PAVs have lower expression abundances which are correlated with their frequency of dispersion across inbreds and on average have significantly fewer co-expression network connections suggesting that a subset of PAVs may be on an evolutionary path to pseudogenization. To facilitate use by the community, we developed the Maize Genomics Resource website (maize.plantbiology.msu.edu) for viewing and data-mining these resources and deployed two new views on the maize electronic Fluorescent Pictograph Browser (bar.utoronto.ca\/efp_maize).\n\u00a9 2018 The Authors.

Also, the great number of gene expression data increases the challenge of how to identify the biomarkers associated with cancer. The random forest (RF) is used to effectively analyze the problems of large-p and small-n. Therefore, RF can be used to select and rank the genes for the diagnosis and effective treatment of cancer.\nThe microarray gene expression data of colon, leukemia, and prostate cancers were collected from public databases. Primary preprocessing was done on them using limma package, and then, the RF classification method was implemented on datasets separately in R software. Finally, the selected genes in each of the cancers were evaluated and compared with those of previous experimental studies and their functionalities were assessed in molecular cancer processes.\nThe RF method extracted very small sets of genes while it retained its predictive performance. About colon cancer data set DIEXF, GUCA2A, CA7, and IGHA1 key genes with the accuracy of 87.39 and precision of 85.45 were selected. The SNCA, USP20, and SNRPA1 genes were selected for prostate cancer with the accuracy of 73.33 and precision of 66.67. Also, key genes of leukemia data set were BAG4, ANKHD1-EIF4EBP3, PLXNC1, and PCDH9 genes, and the accuracy and precision were 100 and 95.24, respectively.\nThe current study results showed most of the selected genes involved in the processes and cancerous pathways were previously reported and had an important role in shifting from normal cell to abnormal.\n","971":"\nAs humans age many suffer from a decrease in normal brain functions including spatial learning impairments. This study aimed to better understand the molecular mechanisms in age-associated spatial learning impairment (ASLI). We used a mathematical modeling approach implemented in Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to create and compare gene network models of young (learning unimpaired) and aged (predominantly learning impaired) brains from a set of exploratory datasets in rats in the context of ASLI. The major goal was to overcome some of the limitations previously observed in the traditional meta- and pathway analysis using these data, and identify novel ASLI related genes and their networks based on co-expression relationship of genes. This analysis identified a set of network modules in the young, each of which is highly enriched with genes functioning in broad but distinct GO functional categories or biological pathways. Interestingly, the analysis pointed to a single module that was highly enriched with genes functioning in \"learning and memory\" related functions and pathways. Subsequent differential network analysis of this \"learning and memory\" module in the aged (predominantly learning impaired) rats compared to the young learning unimpaired rats allowed us to identify a set of novel ASLI candidate hub genes. Some of these genes show significant repeatability in networks generated from independent young and aged validation datasets. These hub genes are highly co-expressed with other genes in the network, which not only show differential expression but also differential co-expression and differential connectivity across age and learning impairment. The known function of these hub genes indicate that they play key roles in critical pathways, including kinase and phosphatase signaling, in functions related to various ion channels, and in maintaining neuronal integrity relating to synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Taken together, they provide a new insight and generate new hypotheses into the molecular mechanisms responsible for age associated learning impairment, including spatial learning.\n","972":"\nThe epigenetics methylation of cytosine is the most common epigenetic form in DNA sequences. It is highly concentrated in the promoter regions of the genes, leading to an inactivation of tumor suppressors regardless of their initial function. In this work, we aim to identify the highly methylated regions; the cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island located on the promoters and\/or the first exon gene known for their key roles in the cell cycle, hence the need to study gene-gene interactions. The Frommer and hidden Markov model algorithms are used as computational methods to identify CpG islands with specificity and sensitivity up to 76% and 80%, respectively. The results obtained show, on the one hand, that the genes studied are suspected of developing hypermethylation in the promoter region of the gene involved in the case of a cancer. We then showed that the relative richness in CG results from a high level of methylation. On the other hand, we observe that the gene-gene interaction exhibits co-expression between the chosen genes. This let us to conclude that the hidden Markov model algorithm predicts more specific and valuable information about the hypermethylation in gene as a preventive and diagnostics tools for the personalized medicine; as that the tumor-suppresser-genes have relative co-expression and complementary relations which the hypermethylation affect in the samples studied in our work.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018.

A total of 20 B cell samples (ten ones, respectively from postmenopausal women with low or high bone mineral density (BMD) were included in this dataset. Following screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), coexpression analysis of all genes was performed, and key genes in the coexpression network were screened using the random walk algorithm. Afterwards, functional and pathway analyses were conducted. Additionally, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between DEGs and key genes were analyzed.\nA set of 308 DEGs (170 up-regulated ones and 138 down-regulated ones) between low BMD and high BMD samples were identified, and 101 key genes in the coexpression network were screened out. In the coexpression network, some genes had a higher score and degree, such as CSTA. The key genes in the coexpression network were mainly enriched in GO terms of the defense response (e.g., SERPINA1 and CST3), immune response (e.g., IL32 and CLEC7A); while, the DEGs were mainly enriched in structural constituent of cytoskeleton (e.g., CYLC2 and TUBA1B) and membrane-enclosed lumen (e.g., CCNE1 and INTS5). In the PPI network, CCNE1 interacted with REL; and TUBA1B interacted with ESR1.\nA series of interactions, such as CSTA\/TYROBP, CCNE1\/REL and TUBA1B\/ESR1 might play pivotal roles in the occurrence and development of PMO.\n","974":"\nFor the majority of congenital heart diseases (CHDs), the full complexity of the causative molecular network, which is driven by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, is yet to be elucidated. Epigenetic alterations are suggested to play a pivotal role in modulating the phenotypic expression of CHDs and their clinical course during life. Candidate approaches implied that DNA methylation might have a developmental role in CHD and contributes to the long-term progress of non-structural cardiac diseases. The aim of the present study is to define the postnatal epigenome of two common cardiac malformations, representing epigenetic memory, and adaption to hemodynamic alterations, which are jointly relevant for the disease course.\nWe present the first analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation data obtained from myocardial biopsies of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and ventricular septal defect patients. We defined stringent sets of differentially methylated regions between patients and controls, which are significantly enriched for genomic features like promoters, exons, and cardiac enhancers. For TOF, we linked DNA methylation with genome-wide expression data and found a significant overlap for hypermethylated promoters and down-regulated genes, and vice versa. We validated and replicated the methylation of selected CpGs and performed functional assays. We identified a hypermethylated novel developmental CpG island in the promoter of SCO2 and demonstrate its functional impact. Moreover, we discovered methylation changes co-localized with novel, differential splicing events among sarcomeric genes as well as transcription factor binding sites. Finally, we demonstrated the interaction of differentially methylated and expressed genes in TOF with mutated CHD genes in a molecular network.\nBy interrogating DNA methylation and gene expression data, we identify two novel mechanism contributing to the phenotypic expression of CHDs: aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands and methylation alterations leading to differential splicing.\nPublished on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

However, little is known about the properties of old and young duplicate genes in Arachis. Here, we have identified old and young duplicate genes in Arachis duranensis, and analyzed the evolution, gene complexity, gene expression pattern, and functional divergence between old and young duplicate genes. Our results showed different evolutionary, gene complexity and gene expression patterns, as well as differing correlations between old and young duplicate genes. Gene ontology results showed that old duplicate genes play a crucial role in lipid and amino acid biosynthesis and the oxidation-reduction process and that young duplicate genes are preferentially involved in photosynthesis and response to biotic stimulus. Transcriptome data sets revealed that most old and young duplicate genes had asymmetric function, and only a few duplicate genes exhibited symmetric function under drought and nematode stress. We found that old duplicate genes are preferentially involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism and response to abiotic stress, while young duplicate genes are likely to participate in photosynthesis and response to biotic stress. This work provides a better understanding of the evolution and functional divergence of old and young duplicate genes in A. duranensis.\n","976":"\nCordyceps militaris, a valuable edible and medicinal fungus, has attracted increasing attention because of its various bioactive ingredients. However, the biosynthetic pathway of C. militaris carotenoids is still unknown due to lack of transcriptome information. To uncover genes related to the biosynthesis of C. militaris carotenoids, the transcriptomes of mycelia CM10_D cultured under dark conditions and mycelia CM10_L cultured under light exposure conditions were sequenced. Compared with mycelia CM10_D, 866 up-regulated genes and 856 down-regulated genes were found in mycelia CM10_L. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated that DEGs were mainly classified into the \"metabolic process,\" \"membrane,\" and \"catalytic activity\" terms. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs suggested that DEGs were mainly enriched in \"metabolic pathways,\" \"MAPK signaling pathway-yeast,\" and \"biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.\" In addition, the carotenoid content of the Cmtns gene deletion mutant (\u0394Cmtns) was significantly lower than that of the wild-type C. militaris CM10, while the carotenoid content of the complementary strain (\u0394Cmtns-c) of the Cmtns gene was not significantly different from that of C. militaris CM10, suggesting that the Cmtns gene significantly affected the biosynthesis of carotenoids in C. militaris.

The available results on mRNA expression of catecholaminergic system genes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are often contradictory. One of the possible causes might be the use of various reference genes as internal controls. In the present study, we searched for suitable reference genes in adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia of SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, which would enable reliable comparison of mRNA expression between these two strains. The mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR in adrenal medulla and superior cervical ganglia of 4-week-old or 24-week-old SHR and WKY rats. We evaluated 12 reference genes by three software tools (Normfinder, BestKeeper, geNorm) and compared them for the standardization of mRNA expression. Combination of reference genes Hprt1 and Ywhaz in adrenal medulla and Gapdh and 18S in sympathetic ganglia were chosen as the best ones. 18S was found as applicable reference gene in both tissues. We found many alterations in expression of catecholaminergic system genes in adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia of SHR. The usage of the most or the least stable reference gene as internal control changed results moderately in sympathetic ganglia but seriously in adrenal medulla. For example, tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene was underexpressed in adrenal medulla of adult SHR using the appropriate reference gene but unchanged after the standardization to the least stable reference gene. Our results indicate the importance of appropriate internal control. The suitability of reference genes should be checked again in the case of change in experimental conditions.\n","978":"\nDespite years of research, we are still unraveling crucial stages of gene expression regulation in cancer. On the basis of major biological hallmarks, we hypothesized that there must be a uniform gene expression pattern and regulation across cancer types. Among non-coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key gene regulators playing powerful roles in cancer. Using TCGA RNAseq data, we analyzed coding (mRNA) and non-coding (lncRNA) gene expression across 15 and 9 common cancer types, respectively. 70 significantly differentially expressed genes common to all 15 cancer types were enlisted. Correlating with protein expression levels from Human Protein Atlas, we observed 34 positively correlated gene sets which are enriched in gene expression, transcription from RNA Pol-II, regulation of transcription and mitotic cell cycle biological processes. Further, 24 lncRNAs were among common significantly differentially expressed non-coding genes. Using guilt-by-association method, we predicted lncRNAs to be involved in same biological processes. Combining RNA-RNA interaction prediction and transcription regulatory networks, we identified E2F1, FOXM1 and PVT1 regulatory path as recurring pan-cancer regulatory entity. PVT1 is predicted to interact with SYNE1 at 3'-UTR; DNAJC9, RNPS1 at 5'-UTR and ATXN2L, ALAD, FOXM1 and IRAK1 at CDS sites. The key findings are that through E2F1, FOXM1 and PVT1 regulatory axis and possible interactions with different coding genes, PVT1 may be playing a prominent role in pan-cancer development and progression.\n","979":"\nWe attempt to dissect the pathology of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients at different stages and discover the novel candidate genes. Microarray data (GSE21933) were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differential expression profiles of lung tumor tissues during different stages were analyzed. The significantly altered functions and pathways were assessed and the key nodes in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were screened out. Then, the coexpression gene pairs and tumor-related genes were assessed. RT-PCR analysis was performed to validate the candidate gene, natural killer-tumor recognition sequence (NKTR). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for stage IB, IIB, IIIA and IV tumors were 499, 602, 592 and 457, respectively. Most of the DEGs were NSCLC-related genes identified through literature research. A few genes were commonly downregulated in all the 4\u00a0stages of tumors, such as CNTN6 and LBX2. The DEGs in early\u2011stage tumors were closely related with the negative regulation of signal transduction, the apoptosis pathway and the p53 signaling pathway. DEGs in late-stage tumors were significantly enriched in transcription, response to organic substances and synapse regulation-related biological processes. A total of 16\u00a0genes (including NKTR) made up the significant coexpression network. NKTR was a key node in the PPI network and was significantly upregulated in lung cancer cells. The mechanism of NSCLC progression in different tumor stages may be different. NKTR may be the target candidate for NSCLC prevention and treatment.\n","980":"\nGenome-wide association studies in Crohn's disease (CD) have identified 140 genome-wide significant loci. However, identification of genes driving association signals remains challenging. Furthermore, genome-wide significant thresholds limit false positives at the expense of decreased sensitivity. In this study, we explored gene features contributing to CD pathogenicity, including gene-based association data from CD and autoimmune (AI) diseases, as well as gene expression features (eQTLs, epigenetic markers of expression and intestinal gene expression data). We developed an integrative model based on a CD reference gene set. This integrative approach outperformed gene-based association signals alone in identifying CD-related genes based on statistical validation, gene ontology enrichment, differential expression between M1 and M2 macrophages and a validation using genes causing monogenic forms of inflammatory bowel disease as a reference. Besides gene-level CD association P-values, association with AI diseases was the strongest predictor, highlighting generalized mechanisms of inflammation, and the interferon-\u03b3 pathway particularly. Within the 140 high-confidence CD regions, 598 of 1328 genes had low prioritization scores, highlighting genes unlikely to contribute to CD pathogenesis. For select regions, comparably high integrative model scores were observed for multiple genes. This is particularly evident for regions having extensive linkage disequilibrium such as the IBD5 locus. Our analyses provide a standardized reference for prioritizing potential CD-related genes, in regions with both highly significant and nominally significant gene-level association P-values. Our integrative model may be particularly valuable in prioritizing rare, potentially private, missense variants for which genome-wide evidence for association may be unattainable. \n\u00a9 The Author 2015.

However, these have been detected in few Shewanella spp. and dissemination mechanisms are unclear. Thus, our main objective was to confirm the role of Shewanella species as progenitors of blaOXA-48-like genes. In silico analysis of Shewanella genomes was performed to detect blaOXA-48-like genes and context, and 43 environmental Shewanella spp. were characterised. Clonal relatedness was determined by BOX-PCR. Phylogenetic affiliation was assessed by 16S rDNA and gyrB sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes were determined. The blaOXA-48-like genes and genetic context were inspected by PCR, hybridisation and sequence analysis. Gene variants were cloned in Escherichia coli and MICs were determined. Shewanella isolates were screened for integrons, plasmids and insertion sequences. Analysis of Shewanella spp. genomes showed that putative blaOXA-48-like is present in the majority and in an identical context. Isolates presenting unique BOX profiles affiliated with 11 Shewanella spp. blaOXA-48-like genes were detected in 22 isolates from 6 species. Genes encoded enzymes identical to OXA-48, OXA-204, OXA-181, and 7 new variants differing from OXA-48 from 2 to 82 amino acids. IS1999 was detected in 24 isolates, although not in the vicinity of blaOXA-48 genes. Recombinant E. coli strains presented altered MICs. The presence\/absence of blaOXA-48-like genes was species-related. Gene variants encoded enzymes with hydrolytic spectra similar to OXA-48-like from non-shewanellae. From the mobile elements previously described in association with blaOXA-48-like genes, only the IS1999 was found in Shewanella, which indicates its relevance in blaOXA-48-like genes transfer to other hosts.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

MORF genes expressions are also affected by abiotic stress. Although seven OsMORF genes have been identified in rice, few reports have been published on their expression patterns in different tissues and under abiotic stress, and OsMORF-OsMORF interactions. In this study, we analyzed the gene structure of OsMORF family genes. The MORF family members were divided into six subgroups in different plants based on phylogenetic analysis. Seven OsMORF genes were highly expressed in leaves. Six and seven OsMORF genes expressions were affected by cold and salt stresses, respectively. OsMORF-OsMORF interaction analysis indicated that OsMORF1, OsMORF8a, and OsMORF8b could each interact with themselves to form homomers. Moreover, five OsMORF proteins were shown to be able to interact with each other, such as OsMORF8a and OsMORF8b interacting with OsMORF1 and OsMORF2b, respectively, to form heteromers. These results provide information for further study of OsMORF gene function.\n","983":"\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are a major cause of hospital-acquired infections and are considered a serious public health concern. MRSA isolates have abundant virulence factors that are the basis for their pathogenicity. The accessory gene regulator (agr) locus co-ordinates the expression of these genes. The aim of this study was to determine the presence and frequency of various virulence genes encoding enterotoxins and adhesins as well as to identify agr specificity groups in MRSA isolates.\nThis descriptive study included a total of 296 MRSA strains isolated from clinical samples collected in Tehran Heart Center (Tehran, Iran) between October 2004 and March 2013. Following DNA extraction, PCR-based assays were used to evaluate the presence of various virulence genes. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows v.21.0 was used for statistical analysis.\nThe results indicated that the most frequent toxin genes were see (120\/296; 40.5%), followed by sea (79\/296; 26.7%); the other genes were encoded less frequently. The presence of seb and seh was not found in any of the isolates. Furthermore, the most frequent adhesin genes were clfA, spa, cna, map\/eap and bbp, found in 281 (94.9%), 275 (92.9%), 267 (90.2%), 265 (89.5%) and 264 (89.2%) isolates, respectively. The majority of isolates belonged to agr group I (53.0%), followed by agr group III (1.4%). None of the isolates belonged to agr group II.\nThe relatively high frequency of various virulence genes suggests the emergence and pathogenic potential of MRSA isolates containing these genes in the study area.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristics of the HD-ZIP genes\/proteins and to study their expression profiles under high and low temperature conditions in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). A strict homology search was used to find 43 HD-ZIP genes located on potato chromosomes 1-12. Exons\/introns, protein features and conserved motifs were analyzed, and six segment duplications were identified from 43 HD-ZIP genes. Then, we analyzed the data from the PGSC (Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium) database regarding the expression of 43 HD-ZIP genes that were induced by biotic and abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments and conducted an expression analysis for these genes across all potato life stages. Additionally, the expression levels of 13 HD-ZIP genes were analyzed under high temperature (37\u202f\u00b0C) and low temperature (4\u202f\u00b0C) conditions. The results showed that the transcript levels of all 13 genes changed, which indicated that these genes respond to heat and cold in plants. Especially for StHOX20, the expression significantly upregulated in roots at 37\u202f\u00b0C and 4\u202f\u00b0C. Our findings laid the foundation and provided clues for understanding the biological functions of HD-ZIP family genes.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By utilizing this gene expression heterogeneity, we can obtain additional information that abets discovery of disease-associated genes. In this study, we used collaborative filtering to calculate the degree of gene expression heterogeneity between classes and then scored the genes on the basis of the degree of gene expression heterogeneity to find \"differentially predicted\" genes. Through the proposed method, we discovered more prostate cancer-associated genes than 10 comparable methods. The genes prioritized by the proposed method are potentially significant to biological processes of a disease and can provide insight into them.\n","986":"\nThe aim of our work was to show how a chosen normal-isation strategy can affect the outcome of quantitative gene expression studies. As an example, we analysed the expression of three genes known to be upregulated under hypoxic conditions: HIF1A, VEGF and SLC2A1 (GLUT1). Raw RT-qPCR data were normalised using two different strategies: a straightforward normalisation against a single reference gene, GAPDH, using the 2(-\u0394\u0394Ct) algorithm and a more complex normalisation against a normalisation factor calculated from the quantitative raw data from four previously validated reference genes. We found that the two different normalisation strategies revealed contradicting results: normalising against a validated set of reference genes revealed an upregulation of the three genes of interest in three post-mortem tissue samples (cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and brain) under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, we found a statistically significant difference in the relative transcript abundance of VEGF in cardiac muscle between donors who died of asphyxia versus donors who died from cardiac death. Normalisation against GAPDH alone revealed no upregulation but, in some instances, a downregulation of the genes of interest. To further analyse this discrepancy, the stability of all reference genes used were reassessed and the very low expression stability of GAPDH was found to originate from the co-regulation of this gene under hypoxic conditions. We concluded that GAPDH is not a suitable reference gene for the quantitative analysis of gene expression in hypoxia and that validation of reference genes is a crucial step for generating biologically meaningful data.\n","987":"\nGene duplication creates a second copy of a gene either in tandem to the ancestral locus or dispersed to another chromosomal location. When the ancestral copy of a dispersed duplicate is lost from the genome, it creates the appearance that the gene was \"relocated\" from the ancestral locus to the derived location. Gene relocations may be as common as canonical dispersed duplications in which both the ancestral and derived copies are retained. Relocated genes appear to be under more selective constraints than the derived copies of canonical duplications, and they are possibly as conserved as single-copy non-relocated genes. To test this hypothesis, we combined comparative genomics, population genetics, gene expression, and functional analyses to assess the selection pressures acting on relocated, duplicated, and non-relocated single-copy genes in Drosophila genomes. We find that relocated genes evolve faster than single-copy non-relocated genes, and there is no evidence that this faster evolution is driven by positive selection. In addition, relocated genes are less essential for viability and male fertility than single-copy non-relocated genes, suggesting that relocated genes evolve fast because of relaxed selective constraints. However, relocated genes evolve slower than the derived copies of canonical dispersed duplicated genes. We therefore conclude that relocated genes are under more selective constraints than canonical duplicates, but are not as conserved as single-copy non-relocated genes.\n","988":"\nIn a large-scale radiological incident, rapid and high-throughput biodosimetry would be needed. Gene expression-based biodosimetry is a promising approach to determine the dose received after radiation exposure. We previously identified 35 candidate genes as biodosimetry markers based on a systematic review. The goal of the current study was to establish and validate a specific gene expression-based radiological biodosimetry using a panel of highly radioresponsive genes in human peripheral blood for improving the accuracy of dose estimation. Human peripheral blood samples from 30 adult donors were irradiated to 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 Gy with 60Co \u03b3 rays at a dose rate of 1 Gy\/min. We examined the expression patterns of candidate genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h postirradiation. Stepwise regression analysis was employed to develop the gene expression-based dosimetry models at each time point. Samples from another 10 healthy donors (blind samples) and four total-body irradiated (TBI) patients were used to validate the radiation dosimetry models. We observed significant linear dose-response relationships of CDKN1A, BAX, MDM2, XPC, PCNA, FDXR, GDF-15, DDB2, TNFRSF10B, PHPT1, ASTN2, RPS27L, BBC3, TNFSF4, POLH, CCNG1, PPM1D and GADD45A in human peripheral blood at the various time points. However, the expression levels of these genes were affected by inter-individual variations and gender. We found that the gender-dependent regression models could explain 0.85 of variance at 24 h postirradiation and could also accurately estimate the absorbed radiation doses with dose range of 0-5 Gy, in human peripheral blood samples irradiated ex vivo and from TBI patients, respectively. This study demonstrates that developing gender-specific biodosimetry based on a panel of highly radioresponsive genes may help advance the application of gene expression signature for dose estimation in the event of a radiological accident or in clinical treatment.\n","989":"\nSesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is an ancient and important oilseed crop. However, few sesame reference genes have been selected for quantitative real-time PCR until now. Screening and validating reference genes is a requisite for gene expression normalization in sesame functional genomics research. In this study, ten candidate reference genes, i.e., SiACT, SiUBQ6, SiTUB, Si18S rRNA, SiEF1\u03b1, SiCYP, SiHistone, SiDNAJ, SiAPT and SiGAPDH, were chosen and examined systematically in 32 sesame samples. Three qRT-PCR analysis methods, i.e., geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, were evaluated systematically. Results indicated that all ten candidate reference genes could be used as reference genes in sesame. SiUBQ6 and SiAPT were the optimal reference genes for sesame plant development; SiTUB was suitable for sesame vegetative tissue development, SiDNAJ for pathogen treatment, SiHistone for abiotic stress, SiUBQ6 for bud development and SiACT for seed germination. As for hormone treatment and seed development, SiHistone, SiCYP, SiDNAJ or SiUBQ6, as well as SiACT, SiDNAJ, SiTUB or SiAPT, could be used as reference gene, respectively. To illustrate the suitability of these reference genes, we analyzed the expression variation of three functional sesame genes of SiSS, SiLEA and SiGH in different organs using the optimal qRT-PCR system for the first time. The stability levels of optimal and worst reference genes screened for seed development, anther sterility and plant development were validated in the qRT-PCR normalization. Our results provided a reference gene application guideline for sesame gene expression characterization using qRT-PCR system.\n","990":"\nDestruxin A (DA), a cyclodepsipeptidic mycotoxin of entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, has anti-immunity activity against insects, but the mechanism of immune regulation is not clear yet. In our previous experiment, the significant expression changes of Bm_nscaf2838_045, Bm_nscaf2674_066, and Bm_nscaf2767_133 genes in a silkworm's hemocytes were found, which suggested that these genes might be involved in insect's innate immunity. In the current experiment, the silkworm cell line Bm12 was used to survey the expression levels of these genes after the cells were treated with DA and the transcription factors BmRel, BmRelish1 and BmRelish2 were silenced by specific siRNA. The results indicated that, after the cells were treated by DA, the gene expression level of BmRelish2 was significantly downregulated, but BmRel and BmRelish1 were not changed. The results also showed that the gene expression levels of Bm_nscaf2838_045 and Bm_nscaf2674_066 had similar phenomena, i.e., downregulation with individual BmRelish1 gene silence or DA treatment, upregulation with combination of BmRelish1 gene silence and DA treatment, upregulation with individual BmRelish2 gene silence, and downregulation with combination of BmRelish2 gene silence plus DA treatment, but no changes in the BmRel gene silence combined with DA treatment. For the Bm_nscaf2767_133 gene, the downregulated expressions were found in individual BmRelish2 gene silence or DA treatment, upregulation in the combination treatment of BmRelish2 gene silence plus DA, and the individual treatment of BmRel or BmRelish1 silence. It is suggested that expressions of the Bm_nscaf2838_045 and Bm_nscaf2674_066 genes are closely related to the Imd signal pathway, but Bm_nscaf2767_133 genes might involve in both Toll and Imd pathways. Furthermore, the BmRelish1 gene acts as an activator and the BmRelish2 gene acts as a repressor for both Bm_nscaf2838_045 and Bm_nscaf2674_066 gene expressions. It also implies that DA may participate in the splicing process of BmRelish where BmRelish2 was promoted. Our research will provide new insights on the understanding of the activity mechanisms of destruxins.\n","991":"\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted agent in the world. HPV6b is a low-risk type of HPVs that causes benign verrucous hyperplastic lesions of the skin and anal genital mucosa. Previous research has indicated that HPV genotype 6 is sometimes associated with high-grade lesions and anal cancer. The pathogenesis of low-risk HPV infection and its relationship to high-risk HPV is not clear at present. The E7 protein, which is encoded by HPV early -expressing genes, plays an important role in HPV infection. The aim of this study is to investigate the human gene expression signature of the HPV6b E7-transfected HaCaT stable cell line. The identification of differentially expressed genes might provide a more comprehensive understanding of HPV6b infection and will allow us to explore the specific role of E7 protein.\nWe established a stable cell line transfected with the HPV6b E7 gene and analyzed the line's genome-wide expression profile by microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the differentially expressed genes. GO enrichment analysis was applied for gene annotation according to functions. KEGG analysis, a system for analyzing gene function and genome information, was used to help us integrate differentially expressed genes into pathways.\nA total of 3519 genes were identified to be significantly differentially expressed between the HPV 6bE7-HaCaT stable cell line and a control cell line, among which 1884 genes were up-regulated and 1635 genes were down-regulated with a fold-change\u202f>\u202f2.0 between the two groups. The expression profiles of the top 20 up-regulated and the top 20 down-regulated genes in the HPV 6bE7-HaCaT stable cell line as analyzed by qRT-PCR were consistent with the microarray data. The most significantly enhanced genes HPV 6bE7-HaCaT cells were SIMC1, S100A8 and S100A9, whereas PXDN expression was markedly down-regulated. GO analysis showed that HPV 6bE7 primarily affected biological processes and that the most significant difference was in heart induction (GO:0003129). Many differentially expressed genes were linked to histone H4-K20 demethylation (GO:0035574). KEGG analysis showed that the most significant changes in gene expression were related to primary bile acid biosynthesis, and the most diverse biological processes were related to systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis.\nThe global gene expression profile of the HPV 6bE7-HaCaT stable cell line was analyzed, revealing the genes regulated by E7 protein and providing insight into the pathogenesis of HPV6b infection.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the CGBI and NIC samples were selected using LIMMA package, and were then analyzed with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Using DAVID software, the DEGs in significant modules were run through enrichment analysis. The DEGs in significant modules were merged, and then a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built for them using Cytoscape software. After miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) were predicted for the DEGs using the WebGestalt tool, a TF-miRNA-target regulatory network was built using Cytoscape software. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted to detect the levels of key genes.\nThere were 390 DEGs in the CGBI samples. Based on WGCNA, brown and turquoise modules were screened as CGBI-associated modules. In the PPI network, key nodes HSP90AA1 and HSPA5 were able to interact with each other. In the regulatory network, MYC, HSF1 and miR-22 had higher degree values. Moreover, HSPA5 was targeted by MYC in the regulatory network. In addition, upregulated HSPB1 and HMOX1, as well as downregulated NR4A2, were confirmed with qRT-PCR analysis.\nHSPB1, HMOX1 and NR4A2 were the key genes correlated with I\/R injury. Additionally, HSP90AA1, HSPA5, MYC, HSF1, and miR-22 might be related to the pathogenesis of I\/R injury.\n","993":"\nHundreds of genetic variants are thought to contribute to variation in asthma risk by modulating gene expression. Methods that increase the power of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify risk-associated variants are needed.\nWe sought to develop a method that aggregates the evidence for association with disease risk across expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of a gene and use this approach to identify asthma risk genes.\nWe developed a gene-based test and software package called EUGENE that (1) is applicable to GWAS summary statistics; (2) considers both cis- and trans-eQTLs; (3) incorporates eQTLs identified in different tissues; and (4) uses simulations to account for multiple testing. We applied this approach to 2 published asthma GWASs (combined n\u00a0=\u00a046,044) and used mouse studies to provide initial functional insights into 2 genes with novel genetic associations.\nWe tested the association between asthma and 17,190 genes that were found to have cis- and\/or trans-eQTLs across 16 published eQTL studies. At an empirical FDR of 5%, 48 genes were associated with asthma risk. Of these, for 37, the association was driven by eQTLs located in established risk loci for allergic disease, including 6 genes not previously implicated in disease cause (eg, LIMS1, TINF2, and SAFB). The remaining 11 significant genes represent potential novel genetic associations with asthma. The association with 4 of these replicated in an independent GWAS: B4GALT3, USMG5, P2RY13, and P2RY14, which are genes involved in nucleotide synthesis or nucleotide-dependent cell activation. In mouse studies, P2ry13 and P2ry14-purinergic receptors activated by adenosine 5-diphosphate and UDP-sugars, respectively-were upregulated after allergen challenge, notably in airway epithelial cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Intranasal exposure with receptor agonists induced the release of IL-33 and subsequent eosinophil infiltration into the lungs.\nWe identified novel associations between asthma and eQTLs for 4 genes related to nucleotide synthesis\/signaling and demonstrated the power of gene-based analyses of GWASs.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

In this study, based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and additional experiments, we showed that all functional bovine IgH genes were located on BTA21, and only a truncated \u03bcCH2 exon was present on BTA11. By sequencing of seven bacterial artificial chromosome clones screened from a Hostein cow bacterial artificial chromosome library, we generated a 678-kb continuous genomic sequence covering the bovine IGHV, IGHD, IGHJ, and IGHC genes, which are organized as IGHVn-IGHDn-IGHJn-IGHM1-(IGHDP-IGHV3-IGHDn)3-IGHJn-IGHM2-IGHD-IGHG3-IGHG1-IGHG2-IGHE-IGHA. Although both of two functional IGHM genes, IGHM1 and IGHM2, can be expressed via independent VDJ recombinations, the IGHM2 can also be expressed through class switch recombination. Likely because more IGHD segments can be involved in the expression of IGHM2, the IGHM2 gene was shown to be dominantly expressed in most tissues throughout different developmental stages. Based on the length and identity of the coding sequence, the 23 IGHD segments identified in the locus could be divided into nine subgroups (termed IGHD1 to IGHD9). Except two members of IGHD9 (14 nt in size), all other functional IGHD segments are longer than 30 nt, with the IGHD8 gene (149 bp) to be the longest.

Reference genes are essential for normalizing and accurately assessing gene expression. In the present study, 16 candidate reference genes (ACTB, CyPA, EF1-\u03b1, GAPDH, HSP90, NDPk, RPL13a, RPL18, RPL19, RPL32, RPL4, RPL8, RPS13, RPS4, \u03b1-TUB, and \u03b2-TUB) from Plutella xylostella were selected to evaluate gene expression stability across different experimental conditions using five statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, Delta Ct, BestKeeper, and RefFinder). The results suggest that different reference genes or combinations of reference genes are suitable for normalization in gene expression studies of P. xylostella according to the different developmental stages, strains, tissues, and insecticide treatments. Based on the given experimental sets, the most stable reference genes were RPS4 across different developmental stages, RPL8 across different strains and tissues, and EF1-\u03b1 across different insecticide treatments. A comprehensive and systematic assessment of potential reference genes for gene expression normalization is essential for post-genomic functional research in P. xylostella, a notorious pest with worldwide distribution and a high capacity to adapt and develop resistance to insecticides.\n","996":"\nThe genomes of kinetoplastids are organized into polycistronic gene clusters that are flanked by the modified DNA base J. Previous work has established a role of base J in promoting RNA polymerase II termination in Leishmania spp. where the loss of J leads to termination defects and transcription into adjacent gene clusters. It remains unclear whether these termination defects affect gene expression and whether read through transcription is detrimental to cell growth, thus explaining the essential nature of J. We now demonstrate that reduction of base J at specific sites within polycistronic gene clusters in L. major leads to read through transcription and increased expression of downstream genes in the cluster. Interestingly, subsequent transcription into the opposing polycistronic gene cluster does not lead to downregulation of sense mRNAs. These findings indicate a conserved role for J regulating transcription termination and expression of genes within polycistronic gene clusters in trypanosomatids. In contrast to the expectations often attributed to opposing transcription, the essential nature of J in Leishmania spp. is related to its role in gene repression rather than preventing transcriptional interference resulting from read through and dual strand transcription.\n\u00a9 2016 The Authors.

This is especially true for the spindle-shaped viruses of the family Fuselloviridae, where >90% of the viral genes do not have detectable homologs in public databases. This significantly limits our ability to elucidate the role of viral proteins in the infection cycle. To address this, we have developed genetic techniques to study the well-characterized fusellovirus Sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus 1 (SSV1), which infects Sulfolobus solfataricus in volcanic hot springs at 80\u00b0C and pH 3. Here, we present a new comparative genome analysis and a thorough genetic analysis of SSV1 using both specific and random mutagenesis and thereby generate mutations in all open reading frames. We demonstrate that almost half of the SSV1 genes are not essential for infectivity, and the requirement for a particular gene correlates well with its degree of conservation within the Fuselloviridae The major capsid gene vp1 is essential for SSV1 infectivity. However, the universally conserved minor capsid gene vp3 could be deleted without a loss in infectivity and results in virions with abnormal morphology.IMPORTANCE Most of the putative genes in the spindle-shaped archaeal hyperthermophile fuselloviruses have no sequences that are clearly similar to characterized genes. In order to determine which of these SSV genes are important for function, we disrupted all of the putative genes in the prototypical fusellovirus, SSV1. Surprisingly, about half of the genes could be disrupted without destroying virus function. Even deletions of one of the known structural protein genes that is present in all known fuselloviruses, vp3, allows the production of infectious viruses. However, viruses lacking vp3 have abnormal shapes, indicating that the vp3 gene is important for virus structure. Identification of essential genes will allow focused research on minimal SSV genomes and further understanding of the structure of these unique, ubiquitous, and extremely stable archaeal viruses.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 American Society for Microbiology.\n","998":"\nSeveral algorithms have been proposed for modeling a gene regulatory network from a time-series expression dataset, but these have been used in relatively few studies because experimental cost often restricts the number of sampling time points to less than that of genes by more than one order of magnitude. In order to reduce the number of parameters for network modeling, we propose a method for grouping genes by both temporal expression pattern and biological function, modeling interactions between the gene groups by a dynamic Bayesian network approach. Results from applying the method to a gene expression dataset on human organogenesis demonstrate that more biologically plausible results can be obtained by modeling an interaction network for groups of genes than by modeling that for single genes.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The comprehensive collection and analysis of the resulting transcriptome profiles would help to systematically characterize context-dependent gene functional mechanisms and conduct experiments in biomedical research. To this end, we collected and curated over 3000 transcriptome profiles in human and mouse from diverse gene perturbation experiments, which involved 1585 different perturbed genes (microRNAs, lncRNAs and protein-coding genes) across 1170 different cell lines\/tissues. For each profile, we identified differential genes and their associated functions and pathways, constructed perturbation networks, predicted transcription regulation and cancer\/drug associations, and assessed cooperative perturbed genes. Based on these transcriptome analyses, the Gene Perturbation Atlas (GPA) can be used to detect (i) novel or cell-specific functions and pathways affected by perturbed genes, (ii) protein interactions and regulatory cascades affected by perturbed genes, and (iii) perturbed gene-mediated cooperative effects. The GPA is a user-friendly database to support the rapid searching and exploration of gene perturbations. Particularly, we visualized functional effects of perturbed genes from multiple perspectives.
